<h2><a name="abstract" id="abstract">Abstract</a></h2>

This specification defines a protocol for retrieving image data from a variety of astronomical image repositories through a uniform interface.  The interface is meant to be reasonably simple to implement by service providers.  A query defining a rectangular region on the sky is used to query for candidate images.  The service returns a list of candidate images formatted as a VOTable.  For each candidate image an access reference URL may be used to retrieve the image.  Images may be returned in a variety of formats including FITS and various graphics formats.  Referenced images are often computed on the fly, e.g., as cutouts from larger images.

<A name="overview"> 
<H2>1. Overview</H2>
</A>

This specification defines a prototype standard for retrieving image
data from a variety of astronomical image repositories through a uniform
interface.  The interface is meant to be reasonably simple to implement by
curators of image repositories.  Through a few targeted implementations,
this specification is meant to support VO applications prototypes and
demonstrations.

<P>This specification is based primarily on two documents. The first
document,

<A href="http://bill.cacr.caltech.edu/cfdocs/usvo-pubs/files/vo-simage.pdf">
"Simple Image Retrieval: Interface Concepts and Issues"</A>,
describes a longer term view of how simple image access can fit into a more
general framework for image access in the VO.  The URL-based implementation
specified here is intended to be consistent with the concepts discussed
in this document.  A prototype SOAP/WSDL based Web Services implementation
is also planned; this will provide similar functionality to the URL-based
implementation, but with a Web Services interface.

The second document, the <A
href="http://us-vo.org/metadata/conesearch/">"Simple
Cone Search specification"</A> provides a means to
query catalogs via HTTP with a uniform interface. A <A
href="http://skyserver.pha.jhu.edu/VoConeProfile/register/showlist.asp">large
number of implementations</A> of the Cone Search specification have
demonstrated that a simple standard based on name-value HTTP GET requests
and the <A href="http://us-vo.org/VOTable/">VOTable XML format</A> is
both easy to implement and useful for catalog data access. The Simple
Image Access interface (SIA) defined here follows a similar approach.

<P> SIA is designed primarily as an "image on demand" service, with
images created on-the-fly by the service given the position and size
of the desired output image as specified by the client.  In the ideal
case the image service presents an image data collection to a client as
a seamless <EM>virtual sky</EM>, allowing the client to "observe" any
region within the coverage of the service, without having to worry about
details such as image boundaries or calibration.  SIA can also be used to
search for and retrieve pre-existing, statically sized atlas or pointed
images which overlap the given search region on the sky.  When "observing"
the virtual sky, image query and access is normally limited to regions
small enough to be represented as a single image.  Larger regions can be
queried when performing a simple search of a static image data collection.
Data collections are often distributed, and the client may query multiple
image services simultaneously, e.g., to gather data from multiple wavelength
regimes or surveys to analyze a single region on the sky.

<P>In operation SIA represents a negotiation between the client and the
image service.  The client describes the ideal image - what it would
like to get back from the image service - and the image service returns
a list, encoded as a <A HREF="http://us-vo.org/VOTable/">VOTable</A>,
of the (often virtual) images it can actually return.  The client then
examines this to determine if it is interested in any of the available
images, possibly iterates with the service to refine the query, then
issues a series of getImage requests to retrieve the selected images.
A key point is that it is entirely up to the image service what images, if
any, it offers to the client.  These images may range from a simple list
of static archive images which intersect the region of interest defined
by the client, to a mosaiced and reprojected synthetic image matching
the ideal image requested by the client.  In the latter case the image
is not computed until it is actually accessed or retrieved by the client.

<P>The bulk of this document represents a technical  specification for
the simple image access interface.  For examples of how the interface is
intended to be used, please refer to the <A href="#usage">Usage Examples</A>
section below.


<br>
<A name="requirements"> 
<H2>2. Requirements for Compliance</H2>
</A>

Compliance with this specification requires that an image access web
service be maintained with the following characteristics:

<OL>
  <LI>
      <DT>The <STRONG>Image Query</STRONG> web method MUST be
	supported as defined in <A href="#query">section 4</A> below.

      <DL><DD>Through this web method, clients search for available images
	that match certain client-specified criteria. The response is
	a table that describes the available images, including image
	metadata and access references (implemented here as URLs) for
	retrieving them.  Images thus referenced may be <em>real</em>
	(pre-existing static images) or <em>virtual</em> (images generated
	on-the-fly when accessed).
      </DD></DL>
    <P></P>
  <LI> 
      <DT>The <STRONG>Image Staging</STRONG> web method MAY be
	supported as defined in <A href="#staging">section 5</A> below.

      <DL><DD>This web method allows clients to direct the image service to
	stage selected images for later retrieval.  The client specifies
	the images to be staged by passing back a list of image access
	references selected by the client from the results of a prior
	image query.  A messaging capability allows the client and the
	image service to pass messages back and forth during execution.
      </DD> </DL>
    <P></P>
  <LI> 

      <DT>The <STRONG>Image Retrieval</STRONG> (getImage) web method MUST be
	supported as defined in <A href="#retrieval">section 6</A> below.

      <DL><DD>This method allows clients to retrieve single images through
	a simple synchronous HTTP GET request using the access reference
	(URL) returned earlier by the image query.  The response to the
	GET request is the requested image, returned with a MIME type
	such as "image/fits", "image/jpeg", and so forth.  Both FITS and
	graphics images (JPEG, PNG, etc.) can be retrieved.  Any FITS
	images returned by the service should contain a valid FITS world
	coordinate system (WCS).  </DD> </DL>
    <P></P>
  <LI> 
      <DT>Finally the image service MUST be <STRONG>registered</STRONG> by
	providing the information defined in <A href="#registration">section
	7</A> below.</EM>

      <DL><DD>Registration allows clients to use a central registry service
	to locate compliant image services and select an optimal subset
	of services to query, based on the characteristics of each service
	and the image data collections it serves.  </DD> </DL>
    <P></P>
  </LI>
</OL>

<P>Here, <STRONG>image service</STRONG> refers to a web service which
returns images or image metadata to a client.  The Simple Image Access
specification defines a number of <em>web methods</em> which services
must provide to implement a compliant image service.  A <STRONG>web
method</STRONG> is a function defined by a web service and called via the
web.  Since the Simple Image Access service described here is URL-based
(e.g., as opposed to using SOAP/WSDL), the web methods described here
are implemented as URLs using HTTP GET or POST.


<A name="compliance">
<H3>2.1 Compliance</h3>
</A>

<p> The keywords "MUST", "REQUIRED", "SHOULD", and "MAY" as used in this
document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 <a rel='bibref'
href='http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec17.html#bib34'>[34]</a>.
</p>

<p> An implementation is compliant if it satisfies all the MUST or REQUIRED
level requirements for the protocols it implements.  An implementation
that satisfies all the MUST or REQUIRED level and all the SHOULD level
requirements for its protocols is said to be "unconditionally compliant";
one that satisfies all the MUST level requirements but not all the
SHOULD level requirements for its protocols is said to be "conditionally
compliant".  </p>


<br>
<A name="types">
<H2>3. Image Service Types</H2>
</A>

It is assumed that compliant image services fall into one of four
categories.  These categories are used primarily to characterize the
service as part of <A href="#registration">service registration</A>,
to aid clients in discovering the services best suited to their needs.
How an image service implements this specification depends on which
category it falls in. The categories are defined as follows:

<OL>
  <LI> 
      <DT><STRONG><A name=cutout>Image Cutout Service</A></STRONG> 

      <DL><DD>This is a service which extracts or "cuts out" rectangular
       regions of some larger image, returning an image of the requested
       size to the client.  Such images are usually drawn from a database
       or a collection of survey images that cover some large portion of
       the sky.  To be considered a cutout service, the returned image
       should closely approximate (or at least not exceed) the size of
       the requested region; however, a cutout service will not normally
       resample (rescale or reproject) the pixel data.  A cutout service
       may mosaic image segments to cover a large region but is still
       considered a cutout service if it does not resample the data.
       Image cutout services are fast and avoid image degredation due to
       resampling.
      </DD> </DL>
    <P></P>
  <LI> 
      <DT><STRONG><A name=mosaic>Image Mosaicing Service</A></STRONG> 

      <DL><DD>This service is similar to the image cutout service but adds the
	capability to compute an image of the size, scale, and projection
	specified by the client.  Mosaic services include services which
	resample and reproject existing image data, as well as services
	which generate pixels from some more fundamental dataset, e.g.,
	a high energy event list or a radio astronomy measurement set.
	Image mosaics can be expensive to generate for large regions but
	they make it easier for the client to overlay image data from
	different sources.  Image mosaicing services which resample
	already pixelated data will degrade the data slightly, unlike
	the simpler cutout service which returns the data unchanged.
	</DD> </DL>
    <P></P>
  <LI> 
      <DT><STRONG><A name=atlas>Atlas Image Archive</A></STRONG> 

      <DL><DD>This category of service provides access to pre-computed
	images that make up a survey of some large portion of the sky.
	The service, however, is not capable of dynamically cutting out
	requested regions, and the size of atlas images is predetermined
	by the survey.	Atlas images may range in size from small cutouts
	of extended objects to large calibrated survey data frames.
      </DD></DL>

    <P></P>
  <LI> 
      <DT><STRONG><A name=pointed>Pointed Image Archive</A></STRONG> 

      <DL><DD>This category of service provides access to collections of
	images of many small, "pointed" regions of the sky. "Pointed"
	images normally focus on specific sources in the sky
	as opposed to being part of a sky survey. This type of
	service usually applies to instrumental archives from
	observatories with guest observer programs (e.g., the HST
	archive) and other general purpose image archives (e.g., the
	<A href="http://adil.ncsa.uiuc.edu/">ADIL</A>). If a service
	provides access to both survey and pointed images, then it should
	be considered a Pointed Image Archive for the purposes of this
	specification; if a differentiation between the types of data
	is desired the pointed and survey data collections should be
	registered as separate image services.	</DD> </DL>

    <P></P>
  </LI>
</OL>

<P>The <B>image data model</B> assumed here is minimal at this point.
An image should be a calibrated object frame imaging some region of
the sky.  Only two dimensional images are fully supported within the
interface at this time, but an actual external FITS file can be of
higher dimension provided the two spatial axes are mapped into the view
seen here (e.g., a spectral data cube should be presented as a 2D image
within SIA even though the actual external FITS file may have 3 or more
image dimensions).  Within the current interface, images consist of a
pixel array, an image header describing the image, and optionally an
associated world coordinate system and spectral bandpass data model.
The actual image file may contain additional information not defined here.

<P>Images can be returned as either FITS files or as graphics images.
For the FITS format, each image file thus returned should contain a
single image in the primary header unit (PHU).  Extensions are permitted,
but their usage is not defined by this interface, and the service should
assume that an external client will only access the PHU.  Image aggregates
are permissible but are not explicitly supported by the interface.
For example, a calibrated mosaic detector observation stored as a FITS
multi-extension file (MEF) should be presented to the outside world as a
set of separate but related images, even if the images are stored in the
archive as extensions within a single FITS MEF file.  In such a case the
service would need to extract each image from the MEF to return it to the
client at access time.  Service-defined keywords or table columns can be
used to associate image aggregates of various types.

<P>Ultimately, <B>VO data models</B> will provide a means to describe
more complex data objects within the VO than be directly addressed by
the SIA prototype.  VO data models are needed for many data objects or
attributes such as the limiting magnitude/flux/SNR of an image, for the
spatial resolution of an image (characteristic PSF), for the temporal
coverage of an image, for any data quality, exposure time, or variance
masks associated with a pixel array, and so forth.


<br>
<A name="query"> 
<H2>4. Image Query</H2>
</A>

The purpose of the <B>image query web method</B> is to allow users to
search for image data for a given region on the sky.  Additional parameters
may optionally be used to further refine the query.  The size, scale,
projection, and so forth of the ideal output image can be specified,
and the service will return references to images which most closely match
what is requested.  How closely the service can match the specifications
of the image requested by the client will depend upon the type of image
service as defined in <A href="#types">section 3</A> above.  The service
returns a table listing all available images satisfying the query.
Descriptive metadata is returned for each image to allow the client to
decide which, if any, images it wishes to retrieve.  An access reference
is provided for each image to permit subsequent staging and retrieval.

<P>The maximum size of the <B>region of interest</B> for a query depends
upon the type of image service.  Image cutout and mosaicing services
are designed to generate a single image covering the region of interest
specified by the client.  Unless the desired image resolution is very low,
the largest region on the sky that it is practical to cover with a single
image is typically on the order of a degree or so (a 1 degree field at
a resolution of 0.5 arcsec/pixel requires an image 7200 pixels square,
or 104 MB at 16 bits per pixel).  Larger images are certainly possible,
but are not very practical for a service which is generating images
on the fly and delivering them to a remote client over the Internet.
A more typical image cutout is likely to be much smaller, on the order of
several hundred pixels square or less, with analysis involving many such
small regions.  If a client wants to use a cutout or mosaicing service
to cover a very large region at high resolution it would need to make
multiple requests to generate and download all the desired image data.

<P>Unlike the cutout and mosaicing services, image services which merely
return lists of pre-existing atlas or pointed images can potentially
support very large search regions in queries.  The same interface is used
in both cases, with the maximum (useful) size of the region of interest
for the image query being specified in the <A href="#registration">service
registration</A> parameters.  Our expectation is that most image queries
will involve modest sized query regions.

<P>Mosaicing services are sophisticated enough to be able to generate
images on the fly given the field center, scale, rotation, projection,
and so forth specified by the client.  To support such services we need
a way to allow the client to specify the parameters of the ideal image.
This is done using a set of <B>image generation parameters</B>.
These parameters are optional - a client is always free to specify them,
but if the image service doesn't support on-the-fly image generation
it is free to ignore them and merely describe the images, if any, that
it can provide.  The default values for the optional image generation
parameters are derived from the region of interest used for the image query.
If the image generation parameters are fully specified these override the
defaults provided by the region of interest.

      These parameters define a nonrotated, rectangular region on the
      sky, having the specified angular extent in right ascension and
      declination, using the cartesian (CAR) projection with the region
      center (POS) as the reference point.  The cartesian projection is used
      here as it is simple and can scale to the whole sky, and works about
      as well as anything else for small regions.  <EM><B>Note:</B></EM>
      the use of the CAR projection to define the ROI has nothing to do
      with what projection we choose for any actual generated images.

      <DT><STRONG>Technical Note</STRONG> 

      <DD><TT> To determine the limits in right ascension and declination
      for the query region one can do the following.  First compute
      the angular extent of the ROI in RA and DEC <EM>at the reference
      point</EM> (POS).  Let RASZ denote SIZE[0] and DECSZ denote SIZE[1].
      The range in DEC is the value at the reference point plus and
      minus DECSZ/2.  The range in RA is the value at the reference
      point plus and minus (RASZ/2)/cos(DEC).  Since we are using the CAR
      projection, the edges of the ROI then trace values of constant RA
      and DEC at these limiting values (the angular width of the region
      on the sky is however <EM>not</EM> a constant).  Candidate images
      can be tested to see if they intersect the ROI by computing the
      coordinates of each corner of the image and comparing these values
      (and the edges they define) to the ROI.

      <BR><BR>Large query regions are well defined for the CAR projection
      used for the ROI.  For example, a region with DECSZ=20 and RASZ=360,
      with POS anywhere on the equator, defines a region 20 degrees wide
      covering the entire celestial sphere at the equator.  A region with
      DECSZ=90 and RASZ=180 at 45 degrees N would cover one half of the
      northern hemisphere.  Regions which extend past the pole are defined
      (they reflect about the pole) but are not likely to be very useful.
      The ROI is undefined at the poles, but can be approximated well enough
      for the purposes of a query by assuming RASZ=360.  <BR> </TT></DD>

      <P>In addition, the service MAY support the following query constraint
      which is used to pre-select images on the server side by specifying

      interest: <P></P>

      <DL> 
	<DT><STRONG>INTERSECT</STRONG> 

	<DD>A parameter that indicates how matched images should intersect
	  the region of interest. The allowed values are: <P></P>

          <UL>
            <LI>COVERS -- The candidate image covers or includes the entire ROI.
            <LI>ENCLOSED -- The candidate image is entirely enclosed by the ROI.
	    <LI>CENTER -- The candidate image overlaps the center of the ROI.
            <LI>OVERLAPS -- The candidate image overlaps some part of the ROI.
          </UL>

        </DD>

	  <P>If this parameter is not present,
	  <STRONG>INTERSECT=OVERLAPS</STRONG> is assumed.  Calculations need
	  not be exact, e.g., a nonrotated bounding box approximation may
	  be used to compute the type of intersection of a candidate image
	  with the ROI.  If the client requires a more precise measure, the
	  spatial intersection a target image with the ROI may be computed
	  precisely using the WCS metadata returned in the output VOtable.
	  For a cutout or mosaicing service this parameter refers to the
	  portion of the generated image containing valid (non-blank)
	  data. </P>

      </DL>
    </UL>

    <P>Note that case is important for these names: the service MUST permit
    these parameter names to be input in upper-case (the service may permit
    parameter names to be case insensitive since this permits upper-case

    terms in URLs, reserving lower case for service-defined parameters
    or parameter values.

  <LI><STRONG>Image Generation Parameters.</STRONG> The service MAY
  support the following image generation parameters (IGP) which are used
  to specify the desired size, scale, and orientation of the output image.
  These parameters are provided for the cutout and mosaicing services
  which generate images upon demand.  Services which do not support these
  parameters may ignore them, but MUST allow them to be present without
  error; the client is allowed to pass these parameters to an image service
  whether it supports them or not.  If the image generation parameters
  are input the ROI must still be specified, and the position thus defined
  MUST be consistent with the region (if any) defined by the IGP.  <P></P>

	  parameter likely be supported by a cutout service.  <P></P>

        <DT><STRONG>CFRAME</STRONG>

	  <DD>The coordinate system reference frame, selected from ICRS,
	  FK5, FK4, ECL, GAL, and SGAL (these abbreviations follow <A

        <DT><STRONG>EQUINOX</STRONG>

	  <DD>Epoch of the mean equator and equinox for the specified

	<DT><STRONG>CRPIX</STRONG>

	  <DD>The coordinates of the reference pixel, expressed in
	  the pixel coordinates of the output image, with [1,1] being
	  the center of the first pixel of the first row of the image.
	  This is a vector-valued quantity; if only one value is given it
	  applies to both image axes.  Default: the image center.  <P></P>

	<DT><STRONG>CRVAL</STRONG>

	  <DD>The world coordinates relative to CFRAME at the reference
	  pixel.  This is a vector-valued quantity; both array values
	  are required.  Default: the region center coordinates (POS) at
	  the center of the image, transformed to the output coordinate
	  system reference frame if other than ICRS.  If CRPIX is specified
	  to be other than the image center the corresponding CRVAL can
	  be computed, but should be specified explicitly by the client.
	  <P></P>

        <DT><STRONG>CDELT</STRONG> 

	  <DD>The scale of the output image in decimal degrees per pixel.
	  A negative value implies an axis flip.  Since the default
	  image orientation is N up and E to the left, the default sign
	  of CDELT is [-1,1].  This is a vector-valued quantity; if only
	  one value is given it applies to both image axes, with the sign

	  otherwise service-specific.  <P></P>

        <DT><STRONG>ROTANG</STRONG> 

	  <DD>The rotation angle of the image in degrees relative to

	  may be rotated in another).  This is the rotation of the WCS
	  declination or latitude axis with respect to the second axis of
	  the image, measured in the counterclockwise direction (as for
	  FITS WCS, which is in turn based on the old AIPS convention).
	  Default: 0 (no rotation).  <P></P>

      <TBODY><TR><TD><DL> 

    <DT><STRONG>Technical Note</STRONG> 

    <DD><TT>The easiest way to understand the IGP is to consider a typical
    use case.  The IGP are intentionally chosen to be consistent with FITS
    WCS (with some simplifications).  A common use of an image mosaicing
    service is to generate an image to spatially match some reference
    image so that the two images can be easily compared.  In this case the
    values of the IGP are equivalent to the WCS of the reference image,
    with minor formatting changes, making the IGP trivial for the client
    to input.  A consistent POS can be computed by merely evaluating the
    reference WCS at the image center, and transforming the resultant
    coordinate to ICRS if necessary.  These should be the values input
    in the image query to a mosaicing service.  <BR></BR>

    </DL></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>

    <P><STRONG>Image Geometry Defaults.</STRONG> The default size and extent
    of the desired output image are determined from these parameters as
    follows: if a size or scale term is given explicitly this is the value
    used, otherwise a default is computed based on the angular extent of
    the query region (SIZE).  For example, if NAXIS<EM>n</EM> and CDELT
    are given then the angular size of the image is determined by these
    parameters.  If the NAXIS<EM>n</EM> are given then the default image
    scale is determined by SIZE.  If only CDELT is given then the image
    size in pixels is determined by the angular extent of the query region
    (SIZE).  If only the region angular extent SIZE is given then the size
    (in pixels) and scale of the image is determined by the service to
    best fit the data and the region of interest.

    <P>In the simplest case, all image generation parameters may be omitted,
    and the generated output image defaults to the position and size of
    the query region.  If any image generation parameters are specified
    these override the ROI-implied defaults.

    metadata.  That is, the reference pixel defaults to the image center,
    the reference value is given by the RA and DEC values at the center of
    the image, the coordinate system is ICRS, and the image is assumed to
    be unrotated with no flipped axes (N up and E to the left), with the
    given scale.  This estimated WCS is not sufficient to define the exact
    image footprint or where the image pixels are on the sky, but it may
    be sufficient for some purposes such as selecting images for retrieval.
    A standard WCS should still be returned in the returned image if at
    all possible.


    <P><STRONG>Spectral Bandpass Metadata</STRONG>

    <P>This defines a simple model to characterize the spectral

    <P>The characteristic value and upper and lower limits should be chosen
    to best model the actual bandpass of the image; exactly how this is done
    is up to the data provider.  Typical values would be the mode or central
    wavelength/frequency of the transmission function for the reference
    value, with the lower and upper cutoffs chosen to include essentially
    all (not necessary 100%) of the transmitted energy.  At this point there
    is no provision for modeling the actual transmission function, e.g.,
    as a reference to an external table stored in some online database,
    although this may be added in the future.  Our intent here is merely
    to model the spectral bandpass of the image in the local rest frame
    (as for a filter), not to provide a full spectrophotometric calibration
    for the image.

        <LI>X -- The image pixels were computed by the service directly
          from a primary data set hence were not filtered by an interpolator.
        <LI>Z -- The image pixels contain valid flux (intensity) values,
	  e.g., if the pixels were resampled a flux-preserving interpolator

<A name="staging"> 
<H2>5. Image Staging</H2>
</A>

By <B>image staging</B> we refer to the processing the server performs to
retrieve or generate the requested images and cache them in online storage
for retrieval by a client.  Staging may be necessary for large archives
which must retrieve image data from hierarchical storage, or for services
which dynamically generate images where it may take a substantial time
(e.g., minutes or hours) to generate the requested images.  Issuing a
staging request for a block of images also permits large servers to
optimize image generation, for example to take advantage of parallelization
for large requests.

<P>A key point here is that <EM> image staging is optional for both
the image service and for the client application</EM>.  Image services
which can interactively generate images on the fly (e.g., a fast image
cutout service, or an atlas image service) may elect to not implement
or register the staging method; images can be passed directly back to
the client by the getImage method without staging them to disk at all.
Client applications will work the same way whether or not they issue a
staging request to a service, since the image query and image retrieval
web methods are the same whether or not images are explicitly staged.

<P>When staging of data is necessary there are two main approaches to
<B>managing image data</B> as it is generated.  The first technique is to
stage data on the server for later retrieval by the client; the data is
only staged for a period of time and is eventually deleted by the service.
The second technique is for the service to deliver the data to the client
as it becomes available.  The first technique is used here as it permits
the getImage method to be identical whether or not staging is used, because
it is simpler for the client (getImage operates the same for any type of
service), because it is simpler for the service in that the service can
proceed to generate the images regardless of the state or accessibility of
the client, and because it provides an implicit network caching mechanism
which permits multiple distributed clients to share the same data easily.
The chief drawback is that the server has to manage a network data cache
on behalf of the each client it is servicing.

<P>Aside from providing the client with asynchronous image generation and
a network data cache, the staging mechanism provides a <B>messaging</B>
capability.  The service broadcasts messages to subscribing clients whenever
a staging (processing) event occurs, such as when a new image has been
generated and is available for retrieval, or when staging of all images
has been completed.  Service generated messages can also be used to pass
informational or diagnostic messages to clients as processing proceeds.
This type of messaging is asynchronous and one way: the service broadcasts
<EM>messages</EM> to subscribing clients as things happen, whereas
clients send <EM>requests</EM> to the service to invoke web methods.
For example, to initiate staging, subscribe to staging-related messages,
or abort a staging operation in progress, the client sends a request to
(invokes a web method provided by) the service.

<A name="staging-in"> 
<H3>5.1 Staging and Messaging Protocols (Preliminary)</H3>
</A>

<P>A preliminary design for an image staging and messaging protocol based
on SOAP-encoded requests and messages exists, but has not yet been tested in
any real implementation and is too preliminary to include in this document.
Nonetheless several examples of what such an interface might look like are
given below to give the flavor for the interface.

<H4>Staging Requests</H4>

All client interaction with the image service is via the image staging URL
(if any) provided by the service.  All requests are delivered to this
URL using HTTP POST, with the body of the request encoded using SOAP.
For example, here is what a fictional imageAccess request might look like.
This request tells the service to "access" (stage or compute) the listed
images, as defined by their acrefs.  An "accessID" is assigned by the
service to identify the staging context in future requests or messages
relating to the staging operation initiated by this request.

<CODE><PRE>
    &lt;?xml version='1.0' ?&gt;
    &lt;env:Envelope xmlns:env="http://www.w3.org/2002/06/soap-envelope"&gt;
	&lt;env:Header&gt;
	    &lt;h:stagingHeader xmlns:h="urn:sim-stagingHeader"
		    env:role="http://www.w3.org/2002/06/soap-envelope/role/next"
		    env:mustUnderstand="true"&gt;
		&lt;h:serviceID&gt;http://archive.foo.edu/vo/sim/...&lt;/h:serviceID&gt;
		&lt;h:clientID&gt;mailto:user@foo.bar.org&lt;/h:clientID&gt;
		&lt;h:accessID&gt;0&lt;/h:accessID&gt;
	    &lt;/h:stagingHeader&gt;
	&lt;/env:Header&gt;

	&lt;env:Body&gt;
	    &lt;r:stagingRequest xmlns:r="urn:sim-stagingRequest"
		&lt;r:request&gt;access&lt;/r:request&gt;
		&lt;r:images&gt;
		    &lt;r:image acref="http://archive.foo.edu/vo/sim/..."&lt;/r:image&gt;
		    &lt;r:image acref="http://archive.foo.edu/vo/sim/..."&lt;/r:image&gt;
		    &lt;r:image acref="http://archive.foo.edu/vo/sim/..."&lt;/r:image&gt;
		    &lt;r:image acref="http://archive.foo.edu/vo/sim/..."&lt;/r:image&gt;
		&lt;/r:images&gt;
	    &lt;/r:stagingRequest&gt;
	&lt;/env:Body&gt;

    &lt;/env:Envelope&gt;
</PRE></CODE>

<P>In this example the request type is "access", meaning access the
listed images.  The accessID is set to zero since this is the initial
access request and accessID has not yet been assigned by the service.
Other types of staging requests include "subscribe" (this allows additional
clients to subscribe to staging events from an existing staging context
given the accessID), "status" (list the status of all images currently
undergoing staging), "abort" (abort the whole staging operation), and
"purge" (release storage for the listed images).

<H4>Messaging</H4>

Once a staging operation is in process the service broadcasts messages
to subscribing clients (if any) as staging events occur.  These messages
are SOAP-encoded, and can use any transport which can be expressed as
a URN, e.g., HTTP, SMTP, Jabber (an open instant messaging protocol),
and so forth.  For example, here is a fictional message which the service
would send to clients when a "staging" event occurs, meaning that one or
more new images have been staged and are ready for retrieval using getImage.

		&lt;h:accessID&gt;1234&lt;/h:accessID&gt;
	    &lt;/h:messageHeader&gt;
	&lt;/env:Header&gt;

	    &lt;/m:message&gt;
	&lt;/env:Body&gt;

    &lt;/env:Envelope&gt;
</PRE></CODE>

<P>Other types of staging events include "informational" (used to broadcast
informational or diagnostic messages during execution) and "done" (all 
staging is complete with either normal or abnormal completion).  The
client can set the eventLevel attribute to specify the level of detail it
wishes to see in informational messages.

<P>All staging requests return a status indicating whether or not the
request succeeded.  Messages broadcast by the service during execution
are asynchronous; the service does not need to check whether or not any
clients actually received the messages.  If the subscription list is
empty no messages are sent.  Subsequent getImage requests by a client
will either succeed, or fail with a DEFERRED status, indicating that the
request is valid but the requested image is not yet available (see below).

<A name="retrieval"> 
<H2>6. Image Retrieval</H2>
</A>

The image retrieval request (<STRONG>getImage</STRONG> web method) allows
a client to retrieve a single image given an access reference or "acref"
as returned by a prior image query.  In the case of SIA the acref is a
simple URL since SIA is URL-based.  Since an image query is required to
obtain an acref, no requirements are placed on the form the acref takes.
This has the effect of hiding the details of the acref URL from the client,
making it easy to layer an implementation of the getImage web method on
top of an existing image retrieval service, and making it easier to hide
changes to the implementation of existing services.  <P>


<A name="retrieval-in"> 
<H3>6.1 Input</H3>
</A>

The input to the getImage web method is the image acref for the indicated
image or virtual image.  The acref for a particular image is obtained
through a prior call to the <STRONG>Image Query</STRONG> web method.  <P>

<A name="retrieval-out"> 
<H3>6.2 Successful Output</H3>
</A>

The output of getImage MUST be a single image or image document
returned with a MIME-type identifying the file format.  If an image is
returned it must conform to the simple image data model as outlined in <A
href="#types">Image Service Types</A> above.  When the input acref points
to a physical image the primary type of the MIME code should be "image/".
Other MIME types are allowed, depending on the capabilities of the image
service; for example, a MIME-type of "text/html" may be used when the
acref URL points to an HTML description and/or preview of the image.

<P> If a FITS image is returned the image SHOULD contain a valid
<STRONG>FITS WCS</STRONG>.  Any areas of the image which do not contain
valid data, e.g., because the requested region extends beyond the bounds
of the source image, SHOULD be flagged with a blank value, using the FITS
keyword <STRONG>BLANK</STRONG> to identify the blank fill value used.

<A name="retrieval-err"> 
<H3>6.3 Error Response</H3>

<A name="metadata">
<H2>7. Service Metadata</H2>
</A>

Compliant image services describe themselves in two ways.  They
advertise their availability by registering with a registry service,
including supplying service metadata to characterize the service and
any associated data collections.  They also advertise their
capabilities through support of the special metadata query signaled
through the FORMAT=METADATA parameter (cf.
<a href="#format">section 4.1.4</a>).  When the service provider
registers an SIA service, the registry can execute the metadata query
to collect the capability metadata.  The gathering of service and
capability metadata from all SIA services enables a client to use the
registry to discover the image services most appropriate for a
particular computation.  <p>

<a name="mdquery">
<h3>7.1. Metadata Query</h3></a>

A compliant service MUST support image queries with FORMAT=METADATA,
used to query the service metadata; only metadata is returned by the
service in this case.  In particular, the response to this query
advertises two things about the
service:  
<ul>
  <li> which input parameters the service supports (see
       <a href="#query-in">section 4.1</a>).
  <li> the columns it will return.  
</ul>
Note that the SIA specification is designed so that
a client does not need know this information to make use of the
service.  The metadata query is mainly intended for use by a central
registry that will collect this information so that users can search
for services by their capabilities.  It is also useful for
comminicating non-standard input parameters. <p>

The overall structure of the VOTable by a metadata request is
the same as described in <a href="#query-in">section 4.2</a> except
that it contains no table rows.  (In fact, it can in practice look
exactly like a normal image query response containing no matching
images.)  <p> 

Each input parameter supported by the service should be listed as a
PARAM element of the RESOURCE that normally contains the image table.
Each PARAM should have a <code>name</code> attribute of the form
"<code>INPUT:</code><i>param_name</i>", where <i>param_name</i> is
the parameter name as it should appear in the query URL.  For example,
<code>name="INPUT:POS"</code> refers to the "POS" input parameter.  All
input parameters meant to be available to clients of the service must
be listed as PARAM elements, including required parameters (POS, SIZE,
and FORMAT), optional parameters (defined in <a href="#query-in">section
4.1</a>), and non-standard parameters specific to the service.  The
PARAM may contain a <code>value</code> attribute which should contain
the default value that will be assumed if the parameter is not set in
the query input URL.  Implementors are encouraged to include, as children
of the PARAMs, DESCRIPTION elements to describe the parameter and
(where appropriate) VALUES elements to given allowed ranges or values.  <p>

response (section <a href="#query-out">4.2</a>).  <p>

When FORMAT=METADATA is given, all other input parameters are normally
ignored.  An exception is the VERB parameter: if given, the service MAY
choose to describe only those columns that will be returned for that

the VERB parameter in this way, it must provide a PARAM with
<code>name="VERB"</code> and a <code>value</code> attribute giving the
actual verbosity level being described.  <p>

<A name="usage-client"> 
<H3>8.1 Client Examples</H3>
</A>

<H4>Simple Query</H4>

In this example the client requests a service to list all the image
data available for some region.  Depending upon how the image service
being queried was set up it may access one or more surveys or other image
data collections.  For our example we query a region centered at RA=10.63
and DEC=41.25 (ICRS) with an extent of 0.15 degrees of arc in each axis.
The image query request is as follows:

<DL><DD><CODE>
http://archive.foo.edu/vo/sim/queryImages?POS=10.63,41.25&SIZE=0.15
</CODE></DD></DL>

<P>This query will work for any image service.  For an atlas or pointed
image service the service will list any image which intersects the
region, regardless of the size, orientation, resolution, bandpass, etc.,
of the image.  For a cutout or mosaicing service only images equal in
size to the referenced region would be listed (since these services will
generate images of the requested size), but they could still
have any orientation, scale, resolution, bandpass, and so forth.

<P>It is up to the client to examine the returned VOTable to determine
which if any of the images described are to be downloaded.  The image
metadata returned in the table is used to perform image selection.
For example, the WCS information in the table may be used to select
only images which sufficiently overlap or match the region the client is
interested in.  The Image_FileSize attribute may be used to reject images
which are too large to be worthwhile downloading.  Any technique could
be used for image selection, e.g., selection could be automated based
on the returned metadata, or the image metadata (specifically the WCS)
could be used to generate a tagged graphics marker in an image display
which the user could interactively select to download the associated image.

<P>Although SIA provides some facilities for server-side image selection,
e.g., the optional INTERSECT parameter, ultimately the algorithm used
for image selection has to be controlled by the client since there are
potentially infinitely many client applications, and only the client
knows what it is trying to do.  Hence the image metadata returned as
the query response plays a central role in image access.

<P>Once the images to be retrieved have been selected the individual images
can be fetched using the image access reference returned in the table record
referencing the image (field Image_AccessReference).  The string value of
this field is the URL of the "image" (real or virtual) to be retrieved.
This field is opaque to the client, but an example might be as follows:

<DL><DD><CODE>
http://archive.foo.edu/vo/sim/getImage?survey=dposs&filter=V&pos=10.63,41.25&size=0.15
</CODE></DD></DL>


<H4>Survey Cutout</H4>

An image service which is set up to return cutouts from a single survey
is no different than the simple query above, except that the service is
dedicated to a single survey.  In this case the image query isn't really
doing a search at all, rather it is used merely to generate the access
reference required to retrieve the desired image cutout.  The returned
VOTable will list one or more images depending upon whether the desired
band (filter) was specified in the query.  The image referenced by each
access reference URL is then retrieved and the survey cutout is complete.
An attempt to access (query) a region outside the coverage of the survey
will result in a no data being returned.

<P>The image service registry is used to discover all services available
for the desired survey.  If the same resource is available from multiple
services these can be used for load distribution, to select the maximum
network bandwidth between two endpoints, to fail-over in the event that
a given service is offline, and so forth.


<H4>Distributed Query</H4>

A typical distributed query would access multiple services to gather
data on a region or regions from multiple wavelength regimes.  Typically
the image services to be accessed are widely distributed.

<P>The registry is first used to select the list of image services to
be queried.  Assume we are looking for all the data available on a given
region.  The same query (as in Simple Query, above) would then be posed
to all the target services.  The query results would be analyzed for
each service and the selected images retrieved.  Some form of analysis
would then be performed on the resultant set of images.

<P>This is an inherently parallel operation, with the same operations
being performed independently for each image service.  Hence all queries
can proceed concurrently - in principle the distributed operation can
be completed in not much more time than it would take to query a single
service.


<H4>Image Generation</H4>

To illustrate how an image generation service is used we first obtain a
reference image, and then try to use a mosaicing service to generate an
image which spatially matches our reference image.

<P>For our example we have selected as our reference image a 256x256 pixel
image cutout from the NDWFS survey.  This is a wide field optical CCD
mosaic survey: the data has been heavily processed, with many frames being
dithered and stacked to produce the final online image data.  Since the
data had to be resampled it has been reprojected to a purely analytic,
unrotated projection, TAN in this case.  The entire 3 degree-wide field
shares the same projection, hence cutouts are characterized by a reference
pixel located well outside of the image.  A portion of the FITS header
of this reference image follows (the OBJECT keyword shown here is a good
example of an Image_Title string by the way).

<DL><DD><CODE>
OBJECT  = 'NDWFS J142859.86+353716.4 Bw-band'<BR>
EQUINOX =                2000. / Equinox of coordinate system<BR>
RADECSYS= 'ICRS     '          / Default coordinate system<BR>
DATE-OBS= '1999-04-12'         / UT Date of Earliest Obs. Used In Combined Image<BR>
FILTER  = 'Bw NDWFS k1025'     / Filter name(s)<BR>
CTYPE1  = 'RA---TAN'           / Coordinate type<BR>
CTYPE2  = 'DEC--TAN'           / Coordinate type<BR>
CRVAL1  =             218.0238 / Coordinate reference value<BR>
CRVAL2  =             34.27986 / Coordinate reference value<BR>
CRPIX1  =               -8658. / Coordinate reference pixel<BR>
CRPIX2  =              -18627. / Coordinate reference pixel<BR>
CD1_1   =  -7.1666666666667E-5 / Coordinate matrix<BR>
CD2_1   =  4.3883176969447E-21 / Coordinate matrix<BR>
CD1_2   =  4.3883176969450E-21 / Coordinate matrix<BR>
CD2_2   =  7.16666666666673E-5 / Coordinate matrix<BR>
</CODE></DD></DL>

<P>If we take our simple query example and add image generation parameters
to match our reference image the enhanced query would look as follows:

<DL><DD><CODE>
http://archive.foo.edu/vo/sim/queryImages?POS=217.2494167,35.6212417&SIZE=0.0183333&<BR>NAXIS=256&CFRAME=FK5&CRPIX=-8658,-18627&CRVAL=218.0238,34.27986&CDELT=7.166667E-5<BR>
</CODE></DD></DL>

<P>Here we have omitted those image generation parameters which agree
with the defaults, i.e., EQUINOX (J2000), PROJ (TAN) and ROTANG (0.0).
Since the image is unrotated CDELT is given by the diagonal terms of the
CD matrix, CD1_1 and CD1_2.  The off-diagonal terms are effectively zero
in the example (4.388E-21), to within the precision of the WCS.  POS was
computed by evaluating the WCS of the reference image at the image center,
X=Y=128.5.  A more general procedure for calculating the image scale and
rotation terms from the CD matrix is given in WCS Paper II.

<P>If we submit this query to a mosaicing service the service will describe
images which should exactly duplicate the spatial characteristics of the
reference image.  Other services will offer images which represent the
best match to the requested image, in most cases using only the POS and
SIZE parameters.


<A name="usage-service"> 
<H3>8.2 Service Examples</H3>
</A>

<H4>Atlas or Pointed Image Service</H4>

An atlas or pointed image service serves a set of precomputed, fixed sized
images from one or more surveys (atlas image service) or instruments
(pointed image service).  The basic task of an atlas or pointed image
service is simple: process the image query URL, and return a VOTable
listing all images which intersect the region of interest specified by
the client.  Each image entry will include an access reference URL which
can be used by the client to fetch the image.  If no images are found,
the query is successful, but a VOTable containing no data rows (matched
images) is returned.

<P>The only parameters which this service must implement are POS, SIZE
and FORMAT.  Optional parameters the service may wish to implement include
INTERSECT and VERB.  Other useful service-defined parameters might include
a parameter named "band" or "filter" of type BandPass_ID, as defined in the
spectral bandpass section of <A href="#query-out">Query Output</A> above.
Atlas or pointed image services should ignore the image generation
parameters: all input parameters should however be allowed to be present
in the input without error.

<P>In operation the service should parse the image query URL and scan
the set of images supported by the service to see which if any 1) match
one of the requested image formats, and 2) intersect the query region.
For each such image a record is formatted and added to the output VOTable:
this is often the hardest part of the service to implement, as access
to image metadata such as the WCS and spectral bandpass is required to
fully describe the image.  If the data is available online, an access
reference URL (acref) should be computed which the client can invoke to
retrieve the image.

<P>For many services image access will be trivial, e.g., the acref could
be a simple HTTP or FTP URL referencing the online image file.  In other
cases the URL might need to point to a CGI, web service, or other program
which extracts the referenced image and returns it to the client.  This is
necessary if the image is stored in a form which violates the simple
image data model.  For example, CCD Mosaic frames stored as extensions
in a FITS MEF must be extracted as separate images at access time: the
extracted image can be returned directly to the client without staging
it to disk.  SDSS (as one example) stores atlas images of faint objects
in a proprietary format which includes cutouts for each filter used by
the survey.  As each band of the atlas cutout is accessed it will need
to be extracted and returned to the client separately.  In cases like
these where some server-side image extraction is needed it might prove
worthwhile to cache the archived or extracted data on disk.

<P>For an atlas or pointed image service <CODE>MaxQueryRegionSize</CODE>
can be anything up to the entire sky (360 degrees).  The
<CODE>MaxImageExtent</CODE>, <CODE>MaxImageSize</CODE>, and
<CODE>MaxImageFileSize</CODE> attributes should reflect the maximum size
image the service can return; for an atlas or pointed image service this
is usually the largest image available.


<H4>Image Cutout Service</H4>

<P>An image cutout service is very similar in operation to an atlas or
pointed image service except that, instead of "returning" (describing)
entire static images, the service extracts or "cuts out" a subraster
from each image or survey field which intersects the query region.
The position and size of the returned image cutout will match the POS
and SIZE parameters of the region requested by the client.  If no data
is available for part of the cutout then the full cutout region is still
returned, but with undefined regions of the image set to a blank value.

<P>Cutout services often serve only a single uniform survey, in which case
a query request will usually return only zero, one, or several images
(one for each band or format at the given position).  However this is
not necessarily the case.  If a cutout service serves multiple image
data collections a query response may reference any number of images,
just as for an atlas or pointed image service.

<P>The required input parameters for a cutout service are the same as
for an atlas or pointed image service, i.e., POS, SIZE, and FORMAT.
INTERSECT is optional, but can be used to reject cutouts which do not
contain sufficient valid data (e.g., INTERSECT=CENTER would require that
the center of the cutout contain valid, or non-blank, data).  Other
service-defined parameters such as a Band_ID parameter are just as useful
for a cutout service as for other types of image services.

<P>In addition to the usual input parameters a cutout service will often
support the NAXIS image generation parameter.  This is desirable to allow
the client to precisely control the size of the generated image in pixels.
If NAXIS is specified, then assuming a fixed image scale, NAXIS overrides
the default image size implied by the query region parameter SIZE.

<P>For a cutout image service the query region size defines the default
size of the image cutout, hence <CODE>MaxQueryRegionSize</CODE>
should reflect the maximum size image cutout which can be generated.
The <CODE>MaxImageExtent</CODE>, <CODE>MaxImageSize</CODE>, and
<CODE>MaxImageFileSize</CODE> attributes should also reflect the
maximum size image the service can return.

<P>For a cutout service <CODE>MaxQueryRegionSize</CODE> and
<CODE>MaxImageExtent</CODE> are probably identical.  One can imagine
allowing the query region size to be larger than the largest possible
cutout, with the service proposing to tile the larger region with smaller
cutouts.  This is too complex to be worthwhile; if any tiling of large
regions is to be done it is preferable to leave this up to the client
since there are many ways to tile a large region.

<P>Since cutout services create new images the service will need to
generate a new image header as well as subset the image pixel array
(at least for FITS format images).  In particular the cutout service
should propagate valid WCS data to the generated image cutout.
