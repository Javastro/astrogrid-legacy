I had to load several perl modules to get the VOEvent one to load - even then I had errors

set PREFIX=~/Library/Perl
on my mac to load local stuff to there.

need

export PERL5LIB=~/Library/Perl/lib/perl5/=~/Library/Perl/lib/perl5/site_perl/

perl -MCPAN -e shell

install Devel::Loaded - for listing modules

install A/AA/AALLAN/Astro-VO-VOEvent-0.9.4.tar.gz
install XML::Simple
install XML::Writer
install XML::Writer::String


--Mysql setup

need /usr/bin/perl event_clientDB.pl -host estar6.astro.ex.ac.uk -port 8099
i.e. different host...


Stap Server setp
get the mysql jdbc jar
