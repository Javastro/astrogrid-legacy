<H1>Maven documentation</H1>
<P> AstroGrid is built automatically several times a day using <a href="http://maven.apache.org">Maven</a> and is
    continuously integrated and tested. Maven generates comprehensive documentation about each component, including 
    javadocs, annotated source code, test results, test coverage, change logs and installation and configuration 
    documentation.</P>

<P> AstroGrid code is available at several levels of stability:</P>
<ul>
    <li><b>SNAPSHOT</b> - the latest bleeding edge code.  Integration Tests results are available, but the code has not necessarily
        been accepted,</li>
    <li><b>HEAD</b> - the latest <em>accepted code</em>.  This test has been tested and accepted by the integration team.  
            It will usually be less than a week old.</li>
    <li><b>Released</b> - fully tested code is released approximately once every 3 months.</li>           
</ul>    
    
    
    <P> Documentation for all of these distributions is available by following the links to the left.</P>
