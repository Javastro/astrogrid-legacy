<H1>Building AstroGrid with Maven</H1>
<p> From Itn05 onwards AstroGrid components are to be built using 
				Maven via a number of custom goals. These may be executed from 
				the command line by typing <BR/> maven {goal} <BR/> while in 
				the project's root directory. </a>
</P>

		<P> All AstroGrid components should implement the following goals. A 
			simple example of how to do this may be found <a 
			href="http://www.astrogrid.org/viewcvs/mavenTemplates/SimpleMavenProject/maven.xml">here.</a> 
			</P>
		<h1>AstroGrid Custom Goals</h1>
			<h2>Cleanup</h2>
				<P> astrogrid-clean === delete all local build products </P>
			<h2>Documentation</h2>
				<P> astrogrid-build-site === generate this documentation<BR/> 
					astrogrid-deploy-site === generate this documentation and 
					copy it across to our webserver<BR/> </P>
			<h2>Build artifacts</h2>
				<P> astrogrid-build-artifact === build all jars and wars 
					locally <BR/> astrogrid-install-artifact === as above but 
					install the artifacts in your local repository (useful if 
					you're working offline using Maven's -o switch) <BR/> 
					astrogrid-deploy-artifact === as above but install the 
					artifacts in the astrogrid repository on Uluru for other 
					components to use </P>
				<P> astrogrid-build-snapshot ===] <BR/> 
					astrogrid-install-snapshot ===]== as above but create 
					snapshots <BR/> 
					astrogrid-deploy-snapshot ===] </P>
			<h1>Snapshot builds - what is the difference?</h1>
			<P> An ordinary build produces artifacts of the form {artifact 
				Id}-{current Version}.jar, e.g. astrogrid-jes-Itn04_1.jar, that 
				is intended for release. A snapshot build on the other hand 
				produces timestamped artifacts of the form {artifact 
				Id}-{yyyymmdd.hhmmss}.jar, e.g. 
				astrogrid-jes-20040227.001934.jar and (usually) creates a 
				symbolic link {artifact Id}-SNAPSHOT.jar to it. </P>
			<P> If you include dependencies on SNAPSHOT jars on your POM, then 
				they are downloaded from the remote repository to your local 
				repository each time Maven is run, to ensure you get the latest 
				version. </P>
