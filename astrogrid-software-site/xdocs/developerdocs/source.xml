                <section name="Practices"><p>
AstroGrid components must be buildable and executable on Windows and GNU/Linux platforms.   Eclipse is the recommended
IDE, but the choice is left to individual preference provided it does not impair our development processes.
All code in CVS <em>must</em> be buildable by <a href="http://maven.apache.org">Maven</a> at all times, both as snapshots and branched artifacts, and it
is strongly recommended that developers install a copy of Maven and build using it regularly.
                </p></section>

        <section name="Building AstroGrid with Maven">
<p><b>This section is currently out of date and awaiting an update.</b></p>
<p> From Itn05 onwards AstroGrid
components are to be built using Maven via a number of custom goals.
These may be executed from the command line by typing <br/>
<span style="font-family: monospace;">
maven {goal} </span><br/>
while in the project's root directory.</p>
<p>For example, to build the
"common" library,</p>
<ol>
  <li>checkout astrogrid/common
into (for example) working/common</li>
  <li>checkout
astrogrid/maven-base into working/maven-base</li>
  <li><span style="font-family: monospace;">cd</span>
to working/common</li>
  <li>execute <span style="font-family: monospace;">maven
astrogrid-install-snapshot</span></li>
</ol>
<p>Maven will build the
appropriate jars and wars and place them in your local repository
(typically under ~user/.maven/repository).</p>
</section>
<section name="The AstroGrid Custom Goals"><p>
All AstroGrid components should implement the following goals. A simple
example of how to do this may be found <a
 href="http://www.astrogrid.org/viewcvs/mavenTemplates/SimpleMavenProject/maven.xml?rev=1.2&amp;content-type=text/vnd.viewcvs-markup">here.</a></p>
<subsection name="Cleanup">
<p> astrogrid-clean === delete all
local build products </p>

<subsection name="Documentation">
<p> astrogrid-build-site ===
generate this documentation<br/>
astrogrid-deploy-site === generate this documentation and copy it
across to our webserver<br/>

<subsection name="Build artifacts">
<p>astrogrid-install-artifact === as above but install the
artifacts in
your local repository (useful if you're working offline using Maven's
-o switch) <br/>
astrogrid-deploy-artifact === as above but install the artifacts in the
astrogrid repository on Uluru for other components to use </p>
<p>astrogrid-install-snapshot ===] == as above but create
snapshots <br/>
