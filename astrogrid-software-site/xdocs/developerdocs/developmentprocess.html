		<H1>Astrogrid Development Processes</H1>
		<H2>Introduction</H2>
		<P> The Astrogrid Development process is the result of wide 
			consultation amongst developers and six iterations of experience of 
			developing a complex, leading-edge system with a distributed team. 
			</P>
		<P> It exists both to ensure the <a 
			href="http://wiki.astrogrid.org/bin/view/Astrogrid/GridQualityCrisis">quality</a> of Astrogrid code 
			and to maximize the efficiency of the team. Consequently, some 
			aspects involve extra work for the individual in order to reduce 
			the risk to the team as a whole. </P>
		<H2>The Development Process</H2>
		<P>
			<ol>
				<li> All development will be broken into discrete, small work 
					units</li>
				<li> When work commences, a local snapshot of HEAD will be 
					taken and a branch created for the work unit</li>
				<li> All development will take place on this branch</li>
				<li> Code will be committed to the branch very frequently (many 
					times a day)</li>
				<li> Unit tests will be built/extended as code is developed 
					(before code is developed, as per XP?)</li>
				<li> Code will be continuously unit tested</li>
				<li> When the work unit is complete and passes unit tests, it 
					will be <a href="http://www.astrogrid.org/maven/docs/SNAPSHOT/integrationTests">Integration Tested</a> locally</li>
				<li> Problems within the work unit will be resolved</li>
				<li> A local copy of the latest HEAD code will be taken and the 
					Integration Tests run locally again</li>
				<li> Again, any work unit problems will be addressed</li>
				<li> The developer is then left with true Integration issues 
					which require the involvement of other engineers. These 
					issues will be resolved on the branch</li>
				<li> Finally, the work unit branch will be committed to HEAD 
					and the results of the automated builds will be monitored 
					and issues resolved (potentially by repeating the steps 
					above)</li>
			</ol>
