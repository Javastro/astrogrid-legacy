<H1>Building Astrogrid from Source Code</H1>
<P>
The java source code for Astrogrid may be obtained from our <a href="cvs-usage.html">CVS repository</a> by anonymous pserver access or via a web
browser.
</P>
<P>
Astrogrid components are built using <a href="buildingastrogrid.html">Maven</a>	and deployed to Tomcat or other J2EE-compliant
application servers.
</P>
<H1>
	Development Environment
</H1>
<P>
Astrogrid components must be buildable and executable on Windows and GNU/Linux platforms.   Eclipse is the recommended
IDE, but the choice is left to individual preference provided it does not impair our development processes.
All code in CVS <em>must</em> be buildable by <a href="http://www.maven.org">Maven</a> at all times, both as snapshots and branched artifacts, and it
is strongly recommended that developers install a copy of Maven and build using it regularly.
</P>	
<H1>Development Process and Coding Standards</H1>
<P>
The <a href="team-list">Astrogrid Technical Lead</a> has specified a <a href="">development process</a>.  
This process is the result of wide consultation with the Astrogrid developers and must be followed for 
the benefit of all developers.  Don't dump work on your colleagues because you were too lazy to follow
it.
</P>
<P>
The following <em>minimum</em> standards have been agreed and should be followed by Astrogrid Developers.
<ul>
	<li><a href="javadocstandard.html">Javadoc</a> standards</li>
	<li><a href="">Component</a> standards</li>
</ul>
More detailed information on Astrogrid coding best practices and standards may be found on our
<a href="http://wiki.astrogrid.org/bin/view/Astrogrid/SoftwareDevelopment">software development</a> wiki pages.
