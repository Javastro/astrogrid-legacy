<section name="AstroGrid Client Development Kits">
<p>
	Client Development Kits (CDKs) are large zips of the AstroGrid delegate jars, plus all their dependent libraries. 
	They provide all the code required to write java clients that interface with AstroGrid Services. However, some parts may be too low-level, quirky or poorly documented for your
	task - we recommend trying out the <b>ACR</b> interface first.
	</p><p>
	We release three flavours, which provide access to different subsets of AstroGrid services.
</p>
<subsection name="Core Client Development Kit">

<p>The <a href="http://www.astrogrid.org/maven/docs/HEAD/aggregate/multiproject/astrogrid-cdk-core/index.html">Astrogrid Core CDK</a> is for
developers that wish to interact with the core Astrogrid services (Myspace / VoSpace, Registry, Community).
It contains all the required delegate jars, plus their dependencies, example configuration, and links to online documentation</p>

<p>
        The Core CDK is available for download (
        <a href="http://www.astrogrid.org/maven/org.astrogrid/distributions/?P=astrogrid-cdk-core-1.1*.zip*"><code>.zip</code></a>,
        <a href="http://www.astrogrid.org/maven/org.astrogrid/distributions/?P=astrogrid-cdk-core-1.1*.tar.gz*"><code>.tar.gz</code></a>)
         and also as a <a href="jnlp/astrogrid-cdk-core/astrogrid-cdk-core.jnlp">JNLP Extension</a> that can be referenced by webstart applications.
</p>
</subsection>
<subsection name="Workflow Client Development Kit">
<p>The <a href="http://www.astrogrid.org/maven/docs/HEAD/aggregate/multiproject/astrogrid-cdk-workflow/index.html">Astrogrid Workflow CDK</a> is for
developers that wish to interact with the Astrogrid workflow services (Jes, CEA).
It also contains the delegates for accessing the core Astrogrid services (Myspace / VoSpace, Registry, Community). (which are also available separately in the smaller Core CDK).
It contains all the required delegate jars, plus their dependencies, example configuration, and links to online documentation</p>

<p>
        The Workflow CDK is available for download (
        <a href="http://www.astrogrid.org/maven/org.astrogrid/distributions/?P=astrogrid-cdk-workflow-1.1*.zip*"><code>.zip</code></a>,
        <a href="http://www.astrogrid.org/maven/org.astrogrid/distributions/?P=astrogrid-cdk-workflow-1.1*.tar.gz*"><code>.tar.gz</code></a>)
         and also as a <a href="jnlp/astrogrid-cdk-workflow/astrogrid-cdk-workflow.jnlp">JNLP Extension</a> that can be referenced by webstart applications.
</p>
</subsection>
<subsection name="Scripting Client Development Kit">
	<p><b>Deprecated - Use the ACR instead</b></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.astrogrid.org/maven/docs/HEAD/aggregate/multiproject/astrogrid-cdk-scripting/index.html">Astrogrid Scripting CDK</a>
 provides all the libraries required for client-side scripting of Astrogrid. It contains the delegates provided by the Core and Workflow CDK packages, plus
 a layer that integrates these delegates into a more convenient interface for scripting.</p>

<p>
        The Scripting CDK is available for download (
        <a href="http://www.astrogrid.org/maven/org.astrogrid/distributions/?P=astrogrid-cdk-scripting-1.1*.zip*"><code>.zip</code></a>,
        <a href="http://www.astrogrid.org/maven/org.astrogrid/distributions/?P=astrogrid-cdk-scripting-1.1*.tar.gz*"><code>.tar.gz</code></a>)
         and also as a <a href="jnlp/astrogrid-cdk-scripting/astrogrid-cdk-scripting.jnlp">JNLP Extension</a> that can be referenced by webstart applications.
