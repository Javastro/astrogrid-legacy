<H1>Building AstroGrid from Source Code</H1>
<P> The Java source code for AstroGrid may be obtained from our <a href="../cvs-usage.html">CVS repository</a> by 
    anonymous pserver access or via a web browser. </P>
<P> AstroGrid components are <a href="buildingastrogrid.html">built using Maven</a> and deployed to Tomcat or other 
    J2EE-compliant application servers. </P>
<H1>
	Development Environment
</H1>
<P>
AstroGrid components must be buildable and executable on Windows and GNU/Linux platforms.   Eclipse is the recommended
IDE, but the choice is left to individual preference provided it does not impair our development processes.
All code in CVS <em>must</em> be buildable by <a href="http://maven.apache.org">Maven</a> at all times, both as snapshots and branched artifacts, and it
is strongly recommended that developers install a copy of Maven and build using it regularly.
</P>	
</P>	
<H1>Development Process and Coding Standards</H1>
<P> The <a href="../team-list.html#ktn">AstroGrid Technical Lead</a> has specified a <a 
    href="developmentprocess.html">development process</a>. This process is the result of wide consultation with the 
    AstroGrid developers and must be followed for the benefit of all developers. Don't dump work on your colleagues 
    because you were too lazy to follow it. </P>
<P>
Minimum <a href="standards.html">coding standards</a> have been agreed for AstroGrid code.
</P>
