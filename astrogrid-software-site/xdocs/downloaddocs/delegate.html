<H1>Software for third party developers</H1>
<P>
	Most AstroGrid components are called via webservices and third parties are encouraged to develop applications
	that interoperate with them.  To facilitate this AstroGrid provides a number of <em>delegate/client</em> jars
	that enables Java applications to call AstroGrid components transparently, without having to deal with the
	web services directly.
	
</P>
<P>
	Follow the links to the left to download the most recently built delegate/client jars for each component.
	Alternatively, list all of the  
    <a href="http://www.astrogrid.org/maven/org.astrogrid/jars/?P=*SNAPSHOT.jar">latest</a> 
	AstroGrid delegate jars, or the last 
	<a href="http://www.astrogrid.org/maven/org.astrogrid/jars/?P=*Itn06.jar">stable release</a>.
