        <section name="Current Astrogrid Releases">
            <P> AstroGrid code is available at several levels of stability:</P>
            <ul>
                <li><b>SNAPSHOT</b> - the latest bleeding edge code. Integration Tests results are available, but the code has not necessarily been 
                    accepted,</li>
                <li><b>HEAD</b> - the latest <em>accepted code</em>. This test has been tested and accepted by the integration team. It will usually be less 
                    than a week old.</li>
                <li><b>Released</b> - fully tested code is released approximately once every 3 months.</li>
            </ul>
			<P> Follow the links to the left for the documentation for the 
				current releases. This documentation in turn has links to the 
				binaries, source code and installation information. </P>
			<!--<subsection name="Itn07 Snapshot">
				<P> The latest build is Itn07 Snapshot.</P>
                <P>
                    This code is the "bleeding-edge" code that is rebuilt several times daily and deployed to a 
                    "nursery" test area.  It comes with no guarantees that it will function correctly, or even compile.
                </P>
                <P>
                    The Snapshot code is installed on <a href="http://cadairidris.star.le.ac.uk:8080/astrogrid-portal">Cadairidris:8080</a>.
                </P>

			<subsection name="Itn08 Head">
                <P> Head code has been tested and accepted by the integration team.  
                    It is guaranteed to build, and in
                    general its integration test pass rate will increase monotonically with time.</P>
                    <P>Accepted code is deployed as needed to <a href="http://twmbarlwm.star.le.ac.uk:8888/astrogrid-portal">twmbarlwm:8888</a>, but be aware 
                        that this machine can be withdrawn for use by the integration team without notice.</P>
