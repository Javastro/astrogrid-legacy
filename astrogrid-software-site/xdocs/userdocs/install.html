<H2>Installing and configuring individual Components</H2>
<P>
AstroGrid components are installed by deploying them to a J2EE-compliant container such as <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/">Tomcat</a>.
Users unfamiliar with this procedure should consult the Tomcat documentation.
Individual components require specific configuration properties to be set.  Please consult the
<a href="http://www.astrogrid.org/maven/docs/SNAPSHOT">AstroGrid Maven</a> documentation for detailed
instructions on configuring individual components.

<P> The quickest way to get started with Astrogrid is to install a complete set of components on a single machine using 
    AGINAB (Astrogrid In A Box). AGINAB is a Maven script that downloads the appropriate Astrogrid components, installs 
    them onto your local Tomcat server and configures them. Instructions for the use of AGINAB can be found <a 
    href="http://www.astrogrid.org/maven/docs/SNAPSHOT/integrationTests/index.html">here</a>. Note that AGINAB is only 
    appropriate for testing and demonstration purposes. </P>
