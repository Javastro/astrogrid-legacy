<H1>Installing Astrogrid</H1>
<H2>Installing and configuring individual Components</H2>
<P>
AstroGrid components are installed by deploying them to a J2EE-compliant container such as <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/">Tomcat</a>.
Users unfamiliar with this procedure should consult the Tomcat documentation.
Individual components require specific configuration properties to be set.  Please consult the
<a href="http://www.astrogrid.org/maven/docs/HEAD">AstroGrid Maven</a> documentation for detailed
instructions on configuring individual components.
</P>
<H2>Which components do I need to install?</H2>
<P> If you have data you wish to publish on AstroGrid then you will be mostly interested in the <a 
    href="http://www.astrogrid.org/maven/docs/HEAD/datacenter/index.html">Publishers AstroGrid Library (PAL)</a>. If you wish to plug your application 
    software into the AstroGrid architecture, then see the <a href="http://www.astrogrid.org/maven/docs/HEAD/applications/index.html">Common Execution 
    Architecture</a> documentation. Finally, if you wish to host an AstroGrid web-site, manage a community of users, or manage users' storage facilities then 
    you should see the <a href="http://www.astrogrid.org/maven/docs/HEAD/portal/index.html">Portal</a>, <a 
    href="http://www.astrogrid.org/maven/docs/HEAD/community/index.html">Community</a> and <a 
    href="http://www.astrogrid.org/maven/docs/HEAD/mySpace/index.html">mySpace</a> components.</P>
<H2><a name="aginab">Installing a typical AstroGrid using AGINAB</a></H2>
<P> The quickest way to get started with Astrogrid is to install a complete set of components on a single machine using 
    AGINAB (Astrogrid In A Box). AGINAB is a Maven script that downloads the appropriate Astrogrid components, installs 
    them onto your local Tomcat server and configures them. Instructions for the use of AGINAB can be found <a 
    href="http://www.astrogrid.org/maven/docs/HEAD/integrationTests/index.html">here</a>. Note that AGINAB is only 
    appropriate for testing and demonstration purposes. </P>
