<P> AstroGrid can be accessed via a web-based portal. Through the portal, users can log in, query 
    the registry, access datasets, build workflows to process the data, and store the results in a personal storage 
    area (MySpace).
    </P>
    <P>
        See the faq <a href="../faq.html#access-prototype">How do I access AstroGrid</a> for a list of portals that are
        currently deployed.
    </P>
<P>
    A user guide and tutorials will soon be available.
