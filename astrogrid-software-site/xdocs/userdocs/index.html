<H2>Introduction</H2>
<P>
AstroGrid consists of a number of components that can be
installed on a single machine or distributed across a network.  For
information on individual components, including how to install and 
configure them, please see the <a href="http://www.astrogrid.org/maven/docs/SNAPSHOT">Astrogrid Maven documentation</a>.
Typically, an Astrogrid component consists of a Java .war file that can be installed on Tomcat or any J2EE-compliant server and
offers a SOAP interface.
For those wishing to write Java code to interoperate with Astrogrid components, client/delegate .jar files are also provided to remove the
need to call the web services directly.  For details please see the individual component documentation.

If you are familiar with the procedure to install and configure J2EE webapps, then the Quick Downloads links to the left
offer shortcuts to the latest binaries.

The quickest way to get started with AstroGrid is to install all the components on a single machine using AGINAB.
