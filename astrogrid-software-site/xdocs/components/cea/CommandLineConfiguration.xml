</li>
<li>

<br/>
<h4>A typical installation looks like this</h4>
<p>The workingdirectory should point to a directory that the process
running the applicationController can write to. It creates
subdirectories in this directory to create a runtime environment for
each of the application instances that it runs. The
ApplicationConfigFile points to the file that contains all of the
descriptions of the applications that the application controller can
run. The contents of this file are describe in more detail on the <a
 href="ApplicationConfiguration.html">Applicatons Setup page</a><br/>
