      <p>
         In general the best way to self test is to start off at your {context name}/index.jsp which automatically does a query to get your
Registry Type.  Then simply experiment with the other jsp pages.  You will find "browse.jsp" the most used.<br />
            Update.jsp is used for updating or adding new xml resources to the registry.  This currently is done with a text box, file upload, or public url.  A Xforms
ability is getting closer, but is currently not in this version.
