      <p>
         Check out {context name}/External_Query.jsp this essentially allows you to query on any Registry in the world, but 
primarily is for your own registry for testing purposes. You may try it on any registry you know as long as you know the query service endpoint, 
 but for Non-Astrogrid registries getResourceFromIdentifier will not work.
