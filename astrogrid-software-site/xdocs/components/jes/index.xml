<section name="Overview"><p>
The Astrogrid Job Execution System (JES) is a workflow engine: it executes science worflows which query datasets (DSA) , perform computations (CEA) and load and save results (Myspace).
</p>
<p>
You might want to install a JES server to execute workflows developed by a local community of users. However, this isn't necessary - any other available jes server could be used.
</p>
<p>
Of the server-side components of Astrogrid, JES is the most complex - it will or may interact with all other server-side AG components - Registry, Community, Filemanager, FileStore and CEA services.

<section name="Build Note"><p>
JES is built using <a href="http://maven.apache.org">Maven</a> and requires the installation of the
optional <a href="http://maven-plugins.sourceforge.net/maven-javaapp-plugin/">javaapp plugin</a>.
