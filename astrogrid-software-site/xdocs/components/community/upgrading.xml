         This page deals with upgrading your registry.
         <ul>
            <li>First go into your Tomcat Manager (Read "Installation" section if your having trouble getting into it).</li>
            <li>Find your registry context and click on "undeploy".  This should delete the war file and the directory.
               <i>*If it doesn't then shutdown tomcat and delete it war file and directory, then start tomcat back up.</i>
                </li>
            <li>Finally you just do the installation and configuration sections again.  In the configuration section
                you only need to change the properties in the Tomcat Administration area.  YOU DO NOT NEED TO SELF-REGISTER AGAIN.</li>
         </ul>
