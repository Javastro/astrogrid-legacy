         In general the best way to self test is to start off at your {context name}/admin/index.jsp which will ask for a tomcat manager username and password.  See "installation" documentation on info about setting up tomcat manager users.<br />
         Now you are ready to begin adding accounts, groups, members, and permissions.  As you add accounts it should also add to VOSpace/Myspace the account if the community is setup to have a Myspace which is normally done.
