         This is the main project to build a war file for deployment and that can be just dropped into a server.  It bundles the Axis
         web service toolkit along with all the necessary jar file dependencies such as all into this
         war file.  The community is a Astrogrid webapp that allows management of accounts, group, members, resources and permissions (currently resources and permissions not in use in other astrogrid software).
         By stepping through the installation and configuration, then you will begin to be able to add accounts and groups.  Then login to other software components with the accounts you setup, such as portal, aladdin, topcat, and workbench.
         It is normally expected that you will point the community to a known database system at your site, but the installation and configuration steps you through an example of hsqldb that you may use if you don't have a database or just wish to use hsqldb.
