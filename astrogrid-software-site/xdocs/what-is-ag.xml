			<p>
      AstroGrid is a UK government funded, open source project designed 
      to create a working Virtual Observatory (VO) for UK and 
      International astronomers. Working closely with other VO projects 
      worldwide through the International Virtual Observatory Alliance 
      (IVOA), internationally recognised interface standards are 
      emerging which promote true scientifc interoperability of astronomical 
      data and processing resources worldwide. AstroGrid is a leading 
      member of this community.
