<h1>Commandline Scripting and Utilities</h1>
<p>
	This <a href="http://www.astrogrid.org/maven/docs/HEAD/aggregate/multiproject/commandline/index.html">project</a> integrates 
	the <a href="http://groovy.codehaus.org/">Groovy Interpreter</a> distribution with the Astrogrid client-side scripting libraries.
	(which are also available separately in the <a href="http://software.astrogrid.org/cdk.html">Astrogrid Scripting CDK</a>). 
	The distribution provides everything needed to 
	develop and execute Groovy scripts that interact with Astrogrid through it's scripting interface.
		</p><p>
	The distributiion contains configuration files, documentation, and a set of sample groovy scripts.
	The samples illustrate what can be acheived though the scripting interface, and are also useful in their own right as commandline utilities to 
	interact with myspace, jes and registry services.
  

<p>
	The Commandline Scripting kit can be downloaded here (
	<a href="http://www.astrogrid.org/maven/org.astrogrid/distributions/?P=commandline*.zip*"><code>.zip</code></a>,
