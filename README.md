# astrogrid-legacy

Legacy code that was created under http://www.astrogrid.org project

This code was transferred to git from the original CVS repository at http://cvs.astrogrid.org and represents the state of the development at the end of the project.
The code is now archived, but some of the projects in Javastro are derived from this codebase, but with the formal history separated.
