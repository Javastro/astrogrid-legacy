<h1>Classes to describe events on the sun</h1>

An event 'coordinate' is usually given as a date/time, and a location on the sun's disk.
<p>That event,
for example a solar flare, is also then available as it rotates around the sun, and
so moves across the sun's disk.  This apparent movement is different nearer the top/bottom
than the middle.
<p>
Thus we have a coordinate in time/horizontal position on the sun that is equal to
different time/horizontal positions depending on the vertical position on the sun's
disk.  (Hmm also presumably different rotation speeds over long periods).
<p>
Sun's rotation is about once per 28 days.
<p>
For TRACE, Coordinates tend to be given as a radius from the center, and an angle
off the what?
