<h2>Backend Plugin for querying other PALs</h2>

This is a querier plugin for proxy-querying other PAL installations.

This is for:
<ul>
<li>Proxies, where we can reach other PALs only in certain ways
(eg SSA from grendel12)
<li>Where only partial publishing is allowed; a fully hidden PAL can be reached
from a fully published PAL, with a much reduced metadata. Though there are probably
better ways of doing this....
<li>Starting to look at distributed querying, where part of a query might be
run on this machine and part of it on another PAL installation.
