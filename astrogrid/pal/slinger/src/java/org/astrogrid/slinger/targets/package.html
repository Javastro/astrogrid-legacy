A set of classes to indicate where things are to be sent, and provide mechanisms
for getting things to those places.
<p>
A rather vague statement, but 'TargetIndicators' are used to represent anything that
can be resolved to an output Stream/Writer. Thus they might represent URLs, or IVORNs, or
even writers (eg to browsers).  The factory method to use is TargetIndicator.makeIndicator(). Since TargetIndicator
is also the parent class this is probably rather naughty...
