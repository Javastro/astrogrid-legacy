The internal Query model that is the '1' in the n->1->n translations of queries
for datacenters.
<p>
The Query package includes parsers and writers, but the core is the Query model
that includes the match criteria and a definition of what results to return.
<p>
The model is manipulated and read by using a 'traverser' (one of them design
pattern things) see QueryTraverser, QueryVisitor and DefaultQueryTraverser.
<p>
The model is meant to be 'self-contained'.  We could make parsing easier by looking
up information in whatever metadata there is on the data being queried, but this
can be tricky because (1) the wide variety of data that could be queried, (2) it
might not be readily available and (3) I specifically want to avoid it so that
we can be sure the query itself is unambiguous, and can be represented explicitly and
clearly so to the user.
