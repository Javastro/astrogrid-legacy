				For your data to be published to the Virtual Observatory, it must be described
				using Virtual Observatory terms and formats in XML documents.  This allows the VO's automatic tools
				to analyse what is available.
			</p>
			<p>
				PAL webapps can generate these XML documents from a core 'metadoc' XML document.
				This document can be partially generated by PAL from the RDBMS database, but needs to be completed by
				hand.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section name="The MetaDoc">
			<p>
				First you will need to describe your data using Virtual Observatory terms and
				structures.
			</p>
			<p>
				The PAL webapps can create initial 'template' documents from the JDBC, and you
				can run this using the servlet at ..../admin/GenerateMetaDoc on the webapp.
			</p>
			<p>
				You will need to fill in the UCD and Unit elements at a minimum, but obviously it will help if you can add human-
				readable descriptions too.
			</p>
			<p>
				Save this file on disk, and then configure this dataservice to find it using the following configuration values:
<code>
    datacenter.metadoc.url=(location of your saved file as a url)
</code>
			</p>
			<p>
				The generator requests metadata for all of the available tables and columns
				within the target database, and so the generated metadata may contain details of
				tables and indexes that you do not want to publish to the VO.
			</p>
			<p>
				To 'hide' these, just remove them from the metadoc.
			</p>
			<p>
				To view the metadata in a pleasant human form, click on the 'metadata' link
				on the left of the webapp pages.
