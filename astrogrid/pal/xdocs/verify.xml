<section name='Introduction'>
<p>
Pal comes packaged with a series of self-test scripts. To run these, visit the web application root,
and navigate to the <i>self-test</i> page. Inspect the result from each script - no
errors should appear on the output.
</p>
</section>
<section name="Initial checks">
<p>You can carry out some checks immediately after <a href='deploy.xml'>deploying</a> the webapp, as by default
it comes with a <a href='samplestars.html'>Sample dataset </a>.
</p>
<subsection name='Fingerprint'>
<p>You can check where the webapp is getting the configuration settings from by
checking the webapp admin fingerprint page (see the navigations on the left of the
webapp's pages).
</p>
<p>
The fingerprint page shows which configuration properties are being read from the
JNDI values configured in the context file, and which properties are being read
from the default.properties file shipped in the WAR file, or from a property file
defined by yourself.
</p>
</subsection>


<subsection name='Self Tests'>
<p>On the left side of the webapp's index page is a navbar; at the top of this
are some self-test pages which will run some tests to ensure the configuration
and querying ability of the webapp is correct.
</p>
</subsection>
</section>

   
<section name="Running test queries">
<p>
The dataservice web application contains simple web forms
(see the navigation links on the main index page)
to submit <a href='queries.html'>queries</a> to the datacenter service.
