<section name="Introduction">
<p>
The PAL webapps rely upon the following software components which must be
installed and configured before installing the Datacenter Server.
</p>

<section name='Java Virtual Machine'>
<p>
Java (J2SE) version 1.4 or higher. Available from <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/downloads.html">http://java.sun.com/j2se/downloads.html</a>.
Be aware that 1.4 does not support IP v6.  The virtual machine ought to be run with assertions 'on', but it is not strictly necessary.
</p>

<section name='Web Service Manager'>
<p>As the PAL webapps are provided in 'WAR' form, they need a web service manager or container
to present themselves to the web.  We have used and tested them with
Tomcat, but others include WebSphere and JBoss.
</p>
<subsection name='Tomcat Server'>
<p>
Requires version 4.1 or later, but we recommend 5.0. Available from <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/">http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/</a>;
Installation instructions <a
href="http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/tomcat-4.1-doc/RUNNING.txt">http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/tomcat-4.1-doc/RUNNING.txt</a>.
Other servlet containers should work, provided they support version 2.2 of the Servlets Spec.
<p/>
Set shell variable <tt>CATALINA_HOME</tt> to the root of your tomcat installation, as described in the installation instructions.
