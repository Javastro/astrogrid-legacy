<section name="The right download">
<p>The Publisher's AstroGrid Library includes a ready-made webapplication for
catalogues of sky objects stored in relational databases.  There is also a ready-made
webapp for solar images stored as FITS files on a disk, but this has not been fully
tested. We intend to release more ready-made webapps for other common datasets (such
as pixel images of the sky).
</p>
<p>
The various PAL libraries can also be downloaded from our repository
   <a href="http://www.astrogrid.org/maven/org.astrogrid/jars/?P=astrogrid-pal-*">here</a>.

The ready-made skycatserver webapp is intended for publishing sky object catalogues that
are stored in a tabular dataset and generally served as a table.
