When you install a skycatserver webapp, it comes ready-configured with its own built in sample database for
	testing purposes.  This database is small and so takes up very little room on the disk, and
	is very useful for checking that your initial installation has worked alright before you
	start connecting the webapp to your real dataset
</p>
	<p>
		The SampleStars database consists of three tables: SampleStars, SampleGalaxies and Plates.  You can
		see the metadoc for these tables by clicking on the 'metadata' link on the installed webapps
		index page.	</p>
	<p>The
	SampleStars table contains a objects described by ID, RA, DEC and MAGnitude.  There is an even spread
		of low brightness 'background' stars in coordinate space at every half degree; 
	which means that this artificial sky is a lot more crowded at the poles than at the equator
	(as half a degree is a much smaller distance there).  There is a little smiley face of brighter
	stars around where the pleidies are on the real sky (ie around ra 57, dec 24 degrees) and a line
		of 20 bright stars from (30,30) to (70,10) </p>
<p>	The SampleGalaxies table consists of objects described by ID, RA, DEC and SHAPE.  </p>
<p>	The Plates table consists of objects described by ID, RA, DEC.  It provides a way of testing and describing the
	difference between Object RA/DEC positions that <strong>should</strong> appear in a cone search, and those that
shouldn't.</p>
