<p>
This page contains some examples on how to run some queries on a dataserver
   directly from the service's pages, rather than through an AstroGrid portal.  For help
   on the AstroGrid portal, see [todo - link].
</p>
   <p>
      Because each dataservice is different - not just the form of the data but what the data
      represents can be different - the examples here are based upon the SampleStars dataset
      that comes with each skycatserver webapp as the initial, default 'test' dataset.
      See also <a href="samplestars.html">The SampleStars dataset</a>

<section name="ADQL/SQL and ADQL/XML">
   <p>
      The Astronomy Data Query Language comes in two forms: an SQL-like form for human beings,
      and an XML form for computers and some of the more enthusiastic developers.  The SQL
      form is easier to read and write for humans, but can be a bit ambiguous.
   </p>
   <p>ADQL/SQL queries look like this:
   </p>
   <p><code>SELECT * FROM SOURCES WHERE SOURCES.DEC &gt; 88 AND SOURCES.TYPE = 'STAR'</code></p>
</section>
      
<section name="Cone search">
    <p>There are also extra astronomical functions added to ADQL.  The CIRCLE has been implemented
      for the AstroGird datacenters for cone searches, of the form <code>CIRCLE('equinox', ra, dec, radius)</code>
      for example:
       </p>
   <p><code>SELECT * FROM SOURCES WHERE CIRCLE('J2000', 57, 24, 2) </code></p>
   <p>will select those objects in the area of the pleidies, where ra=57, dec=24 and the radius=2 degrees.</p>
