<h2><a name="sec1" id="sec1">1. Introduction</a></h2>
<p>The Common Execution Architecture (CEA) is an attempt to create a
reasonably small set of interfaces and schema to model how to execute a
typical Astronomical application within the Virtual Observatory (VO).
In this context an application can be any process that consumes or
produces data, so in existing terminology could include </p>
<ul>
  <li>A unix command line application</li>
  <li>A database query</li>
  <li>A web service</li>
</ul>
<p>The CEA has been primarily designed to work within a web services
calling mechanism, although it is possible to have specific language
bindings using the same interfaces. For example Astrogrid has a java
implementation of the interfaces that can be called directly from a
java executable.</p>
<br />
<h3><a name="sec11" id="sec11">1.1 Motivation</a></h3>
<p>The primary requirements motivating the creation of this
architecture are;</p>
<ul>
  <li>To create a uniform interface and model for an application and
its parameters. This has twin benefits;
    <ol>
      <li>It allows VO infrastructure writers a single model of an
application that that have to code for.</li>
      <li>Application writers know what they have to implement to be
compatible with a VO Infrastructure.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>To provide a higher level description than WSDL 1.1 can offer.
    <ul>
      <li>Restrict the almost limitless possibilities allowed by WSDL
into a managable subset.</li>
      <li>Provide specific semantics for some astronomical quantities.</li>
      <li>Provide extra information not allowed in WSDL - e.g. default
values, descriptions for use in a GUI etc. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>To provide extenstions with the VO Resource schema <a
 href="http://www.ivoa.net/twiki/bin/view/IVOA/IVOARegWp03#VOResource_a_Resource_Metadata_S">(See
the IVOA WG)</a> that can describe a general application</li>
  <li>To provide asynchronous operation of an application - This is
essential as the call tree that invokes the application cannot be
expected to be active for extremely long lasting operations - e.g. a
user from a web browser invokes a data-mining operation that takes days</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide callback for notification of finishing.</li>
    <li>Provide polling mechanisms for status.<br />
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>To allow for the data flow to not necessarily have to follow the
call tree. In a typical application execution the results are returned
to the invoking process - In a VO scenario, it can be useful if the
application can be instructed to pass the results on to a different
location.<br />
  </li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="sec1_2" id="sec1_2">1.2 Origins</a></h3>
<p>The design for this architecture has evolved from the requirements
fot the Workflow/Job Execution System components within AstroGrid. It
was desireable for the job execution system to have a single model for
an application, so that it could deal with the (already complex)
problems of scheduling, looping, conditional execution etc. without
needing to have specializations for all the different types of service
(SIA, Database query, Cone Search, etc.) that it might be required to
invoke.</p>
<p>Amongst the VO specifications there was no existing model for
applications that was defined at the level at which this design
attempts to address. In the VOResource schema an application is defined
as a Service with the interface definition. The interface defintion
either relies on referring to a WSDL definition of the service, or on
other schema extending the service definition to provide some specific
detail as in the case of a Simple Image Access service. There is no
general definition of an application in the resource.</p>
<p>It is clear that the WSDL model of an interface has had a large
influence on the design of the CEA, but it should be remembered that
the CEA is intentionally layered on top of WSDL,&nbsp; so that CEA
controls the scope and semantics of operations. There is only one WSDL
defintion for all applications, so as far as web services are concerned
the interface is constant.&nbsp; CEA works by transporting meta
information about the application interface within this constant WSDL
interface.
</p>
<h2><a name="sec2" id="sec2">2. Formal Definition</a></h2>
<h3></h3>
<h3><a name="sect1_3" id="sect1_3">2.1 Components</a></h3>
<ul>
<li> Application - This is the process that is to
be executed. It is
defined as a process that can consume or create data. So this can
include unix command line tools, database queries, web services etc.</li>
  <li>Common Execution Controller - this is the component that
implements the CommonExecutionConnector interface, and actually
controls the execution of the application. There can be various
specialisms of this service, such as the
CommandLineApplicationContoller, which can be configured to invoke a
general unix command line tool, a WebServiceApplicationContoller, which
can be configured to act as a proxy to call a general web service in a
uniform manner</li>
  <li>Invoking process</li>
  <li>Monitoring Service - This is a service that the Common Execution
Controller can report status to - it can of course be </li>
  <li>Storage Service - this is the mechanism by which the application
can return its results. It can encompass a wide variety of mechansims
e.g.
    <ul>
      <li>SOAP messages</li>
      <li>http get/put</li>
      <li>SOAP attachments</li>
      <li>ftp/gridftp</li>
      <li>MySpace</li>
      <li>local filestore</li>
      <li>etc.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<br />
<h3>2.2 Interactions</h3>
<a
 href="http://www.astrogrid.org/viewcvs/*checkout*/astrogrid/applications/design/CEACallSequence.gif?rev=HEAD&amp;content-type=image/gif" target="umldiagram"><img
 style="border: 0px solid ; height: 720px; width: 900px;"
 alt="CEA UML Sequence Diagram"
 src="http://www.astrogrid.org/viewcvs/*checkout*/astrogrid/applications/design/CEACallSequence.gif?rev=HEAD&amp;content-type=image/gif" /></a>
<p>The above sequence diagram illustrates how the various components of
the CEA system interact when an application is executed.&nbsp; The
steps are</p>
<ol>
  <li>The invoking process calls the execute method of the CommonExecutionConnector
    interface, which is implemented by the component known as the CommonExectionController.
    This will cause asynchronous execution of the application and will return
    immediately
    with
    an executionID
    which
    is
    the
    identifier by which the<em> CommonExecutionController keeps track</em> of 
    this
    particular execution instance. The parameters to this call are
    <ul>
      <li>A Tool object - This is described in more <a href="#Tool">detail below</a>.</li>
      <li>JobIdtentifier - this is the identifier by which the <em>invoking process
        uses to keep track </em>of this particular execution instance.</li>
      <li>Monitor endpoint URL - this is the endpoint of the service that implements
        the Job Monitor interface that the CommonExecutionController can call
        to inform the monitoring process of the status of the execution instance.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The CommonExecutionConfroller will then start the application.</li>
  <li>The application can then optionally return status information to the CommonExecutionController
    which will then pass this on to the Monitor Service.</li>
  <li>When the application completes it will inform the CommonExecutionController
    which will then pass the results on to the storage service and inform the
    monitor service that the application has finished.</li>
</ol>
<p>Some point of note;</p>
<ul>
  <li>The monitoring service could equally be the same as the invoking
service - they are shown as conceptually separate, as the endpoint of
this service is passed in as an argument to the call</li>
  <li>The only guaranteed status message that the monitoring service
will receive is the one informing it that the application has finished
(or failed). The application might be capable of sending intermediate
messages whilst it is sill executing, but this is not required. </li>
  <li>The results of the application running are not returned directly
to the invoking process. The final destination for the results is
implicit in the specification of the output parameters, and it is the
responsibility of the CommonExecutionController to ensure that they get
there.</li>
</ul>
<h3>2.3 Interfaces</h3>
<h5>CommonExecutionConnector</h5>
<p>This is the main interface that is used to communicate with the
application. The main methods (ports) are (please note that there are some
extra methods defined in the WSDL that are defined for experimental
purposes in the interaction with the registry - This interaction will be finalised
  in the )</p>
<ol>
  <li>execute</li>
  <li>abort (This can be used to abort the execution of an application)</li>
</ol>
<p>The WSDL definition of this interface is stored in cvs at <a
 href="http://www.astrogrid.org/viewcvs/*checkout*/astrogrid/workflow-objects/wsdl/CommonExecutionConnnector.wsdl?rev=HEAD">http://www.astrogrid.org/viewcvs/*checkout*/astrogrid/workflow-objects/wsdl/CommonExecutionConnnector.wsdl?rev=HEAD</a></p>

<h5>JobMonitorService</h5>
<p>The WSDL definition of this interface is stored in cvs at <a
 href="http://www.astrogrid.org/viewcvs/*checkout*/astrogrid/workflow-objects/wsdl/JobMonitor.wsdl?rev=HEAD">http://www.astrogrid.org/viewcvs/*checkout*/astrogrid/workflow-objects/wsdl/JobMonitor.wsdl?rev=HEAD</a></p>
<h3><a name="objects" id="objects"></a>2.4 Objects</h3>
<p>The objects that participate in CEA can be split into two groups</p>
<ol>
  <li>Those used to describe the application in the registry
    <ul>
      <li><em>Application</em> the overall application, which has a series of</li>
      <li><em>Parameter </em>which are the detailed desciptions of the parameters
        and their types.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Those used to describe the application in the WSDL interface
    <ul>
      <li><em>Tool</em> - 
 An instance of an application with real parameter values. </li>
      <li><em>ParameterValue</em> which is used to pass a values to a Tool.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>These are described in more detail in the following sections.</p>
<h4>2.4.1 Application</h4>
<p>uml model</p>
<img
 src="http://www.astrogrid.org/viewcvs/*checkout*/astrogrid/applications/design/ceaApplication.gif?rev=HEAD&amp;content-type=image/gif" />
<p>As this model depicts an application in CEA is really quite a simple
entity consisting of 1 or more interfaces that consist of 0 or more
input parameters and 0 or more output parameters.</p>
<p>The schema representation is shown below, and is essentially a
representation of the UML model that has been coded to recognise that
the same parameter can occur in several interfaces.</p>
<p><img src="ApplicationBase.png" />
</p>
<p>This diagram also shows a number of specialized elements all within the substitution
  group which has <span class="element">Parameter</span> as the head. These are
  implementation details where extra information is needed to specify how to
  use the parameters - for example in the case of a command line parameter it
  is necessary to know the command line switch or position that the parameter
  appears at.</p>
<h4>2.4.2 Parameter</h4>
<p>The description of the parameters and the parameter values are
probably the heart of the CEA. It is the model for the parameters that
allow us to add semantic meaning, and to give the flexibility in how
the parameters are transported. The implementation is still in its
infancy, but it is hoped that the parameter definition will be extented
to encompass any data models that the VO produces.</p>
<p>The basic parameter definition from the schema is shown below</p>
<p><img src="BaseParameterDefintion.png" />
</p>
<h4><a name="Tool" id="Tool"></a>2.4.3 Tool</h4>
<p>The <a href="http://www.astrogrid.org/maven/docs/snapshot/astrogrid-workflow-objects/schema/AGParameterDefinition.html#element_tool">tool</a> represents
  the full collection of parameters that are passed to a particular interface
  of an application and the results that are returned.</p>
<img height="227" src="Tool.png" width="721" />
<h4>2.4.4 ParameterValue</h4>
<p>The <a
 href="http://www.astrogrid.org/maven/docs/snapshot/astrogrid-workflow-objects/schema/AGParameterDefinition.html#type_parameterValue">parameterValue</a>
model is simple but powerful representation of the parameters that are passed
  to an application. The parameterValue element has 3 attributes</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Name</b></li>
  <li><b>Type</b> this describes the data type of the parameter. It can
range from simple atomic types such and integer and string to specific
astronomical types such as right ascension and declination all the way
to complex structures such as VOTables and FITS files.</li>
  <li><b>Transport</b> this describes the transport method to obtain or
return a parameter. For an input parameter the default is for the
parameter value to be contained within the calling SOAP message,
however for an output parameter there is no such default and this
attribute must be given a value. The different sorts of transport
include
    <ul>
      <li>SOAP messages</li>
      <li>http get/put</li>
      <li>SOAP attachments</li>
      <li>ftp/gridftp</li>
      <li>MySpace</li>
      <li>local filestore</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the current implementation has the type and transport
attributes combined as one - so that there can be a type of
MySpace_VOTableReference for instance - the full implementation will
have them separated as described above for more flexibility.</p>
<h3><a name="schema" id="schema"></a>2.5 Schema</h3>
<p>The schema associated with the CEA fall into two categories</p>
<ol>
  <li>The schema used to define the messages within the
CommonExecutionConnector interface.</li>
  <li>The schema that is used to define the VOResource extension for
CEA.</li>
</ol>
<p>These schema are strongly interelated (as they are imported in both
the WSDL and Registry Schema), which aids programming with
automated object generation tools, as there are many common objects.
The schema associated with CEA are
described below with links to their documentation.</p>

<h4>2.5.1 Discussion of the VOResource Extension </h4>
<p>It is a valid question to ask whether there needed to be a specific VOResource
  extension to accomodate the CEA. The standard <span class="element">Service
  </span>element exepects the interface to the service to be described in WSDL,
  so given that CEA has <em>constant</em> WSDL definitions for <em>different</em> applications
  therre needs to be a way of expressing the fact that a particular <span class="element">CeaService</span>  can
  run a particular set of applications. The method that was chosen was to extend
  <span class="element">Service</span> with an element that is just an aggregation
  of pointers to the actual application defintions defined in <span class="element">CeaApplication</span>  which
  is an extension of the standard <span class="element">ResourceType</span>.
  These relationships are illustrated in the UML below.</p>
<p><img height="331" src="RegistryDomain.gif" width="641" /></p>
<p>For a particular application there should  be only one CeaApplication entry
  in the registry. This entry will define everything that is necessary to run
  the application excepf for the endpoint of the service. This implies that to
  find a particular instance of a particular application is a two stage registry
  query. </p>
<ol>
  <li>Query the registry to find the application of interest - note the parameter
    data and the IVOA identifier for the application.</li>
  <li>Query a second time to find the CeaService(s) that can run the application
    with that IVOA identifier.</li>
</ol>
<p>The diagram illustrates
    the point that one <span class="element">CeaService</span> may
    run several <span class="element">CeaApplication</span>s
    and that a particular <span class="element">CeaApplication</span> can be
    run by serveral <span class="element">CeaService</span>s.</p>
<h2><a name="Deployment" id="Deployment"></a>3 Deployment</h2>
<h3>3.1 Typical Scenario</h3>
<a href="http://www.astrogrid.org/viewcvs/*checkout*/astrogrid/applications/design/CEADeployment.gif?rev=HEAD&content-type=image/gif" target="umldiagram"><img alt="UML Deployment" border="0" height="459"
 src="http://www.astrogrid.org/viewcvs/*checkout*/astrogrid/applications/design/CEADeployment.gif?rev=HEAD&amp;content-type=image/gif" width="834" /></a>
<p>This deployment shows some of the features of using the CEA</p>
<ul>
  <li>On the right hand side of the diagram there are command line
applications that are wrapped by specialized CommonExecutionControllers
that allow the workflow engine to use the CommonExecutionConnector
interface to communicate</li>
  <li>There is a webservices proxy component that can act as an adapter
between a generic web service and the CommonExecutionConnector interface</li>
  <li>On the left of the diagram the webservices proxy is localised
with a web service so that the results returned by the webservice can
be stored locally thus minimising network traffic</li>
</ul>
<br />
<h3> 3.2 What it means for an Application to be CEA compliant</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Implement the CommonExecutionConnector interfaces.</li>
  <li>Be prepared to make a call back to the Job Monitor interface with intermediate
    and final execution status.</li>
  <li>Understand how to interpret all the parameter types.</li>
  <li>Be able to support all the transport mechanisms for output parameters.</li>
</ul>
<h3>3.3 <a href="http://www.astrogrid.org/">Astrogrid</a> Implementation</h3>
<p>The CEA is implemented in the following astrogrid components</p>
<ul>
  <li>Applications Integration (<a href="http://www.astrogrid.org/maven/docs/snapshot/applications/index.html">maven
  documentation</a>). This currently implements a specialized CommonExecutionController
  that can execute unix command line applications. In iteration 6 of Astrogrid,
  there are plans to create a CommonExecutionController that can execute arbitrary
  web services.</li>
  <li>Workflow Common Objects (<a href="http://www.astrogrid.org/maven/docs/snapshot/astrogrid-workflow-objects/index.html">maven
  documentation</a>). This project holds all of the schema and WSDL definitions
  that are used by CEA based services in Astrogrid. Additionally it contains
  <a href="http://www.castor.org/">Castor</a> generated object bindings for the schema and the <a href="http://ws.apache.org/axis/">Axis</a> generated web
  services stubs for the service.</li>
  <li>Job Execution System (maven documentation). This is the engine of the Astrogrid

<h2><a name="Future" id="Future"></a>4 Future Directions</h2>
<h3>4.1 What needs to be done to make this suitable for adoption by the IVOA</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Refactor the schema to remove some of the astrogrid specific
parts - particulary the tool element needs to be removed from workflow
and placed in AGApplicationBase.xsd schema.</li>
  <li>The status callback can be defined in the same WSDL as the main
interface.</li>
  <li>Renaming of components/files to not include astrogrid references.</li>
  <li>Bring into line with the new VOResource<br />
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>4.2 Extensions</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Add an explicit method of returning results</li>
  <li><a

  AsynchronousActivityProposal</a></li>
  <li>Including work from the DM workgroup on basic parameter types - perhaps
    extend the number of types that CEA &quot;understands&quot;.</li>
  <li>Think about Capability/ontology. </li>
</ul>
