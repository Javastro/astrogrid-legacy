    <subsection name="Introduction">
        <p>The Common Execution Architecture (CEA) is an attempt to create a reasonably small set of interfaces and schema
           to model how to execute a typical Astronomical application within the Virtual Observatory (VO). 
           In this context an application can be any process that consumes or produces data. </p>
           <p>The CEA has been primarily designed to work within a web services calling mechanism, although it is possible to have specific language bindings using the same interfaces. 
               For example Astrogrid has a java implementation of the interfaces that can be called directly from other </p>
