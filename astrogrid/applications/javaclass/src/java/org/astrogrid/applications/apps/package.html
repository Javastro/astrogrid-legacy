		<h1>Applications</h1>
		This package contains various bespoke implementations of Application Description, that provide different java-based applications.
		These applications are written by extending AbstractApplicationDescription, rather than using the JavaClass provider, so that they have a fuller set of metadata available.
		(currently, javaclass provider doesn't get much more than the method name, etc).
		
		All these applications may be registered with a CEAComponentManager, where they will be picked up by the containerApplicationDescriptionLibrary.
