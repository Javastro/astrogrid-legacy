      | Community snippet is critical.
      | It should be used universally to carry user identification.
      | This is a change from earlier iterations, where we each
      | invented our own way of passing this information.
      | Refactoring required in numbers of components!!
      | Perhaps community snippet should carry community id
      | separately.
      | Arguably, we should also all be using namespaces in 
      | Astrogrid? Community snippet has already caused a name clash.

      | The following is a distinct change from iteration 3
      | where JES knew nothing about sequences or flows, but
      | only job steps. It managed sequencing and parallelism by
      | use of step numbers and sequence numbers. This aspect
      | was a pretty creaky short-term measure, and will probably
      | not be robust enough if/when other facilities are added 
      | (e.g. conditional execution).
