Want to introduce concept of variables - I have kept the name resources to make it easier to compare with jeff's example, but they are now very explicitly refernces to things that can 
be in mySpace

(local and global)

want explicit input/output

want to reference the standard schema on this

possibly have a single document describe workflow and jobentry....


put in explicit name of the tool

made explicit what the input and output parameters are

made references to the global and local references from whithin the parameter definitions....

resources logically separate from the application parameters- Job Contoller performs the mapping between the two


showed some use of namespaces, but without the proper declarations - 

co = community
pd = parameter definition

note - myspace refs made up and not of the correct form.
