    <![CDATA[ The applications integration component provides users with a mechanism to run applications. They will most often be run from a workflow component, rather than being invoked directly. <p> The main functionality that this component provides is. <ol> <li>A standard description of application parameters that allows for automated GUI building and workflow creation.</li> <li>A wrapper to allow the application to retrieve/store information in MySpace.</li> </ol> This functionality is provided with the ApplicationController service, of which there can be specializations to call command line applications, datacentre and other general web services. In iteration 4 there is only a specialization to call command line applications. </p> ]]>
