      <h2>External testing</h2>
      <p> External testing  (i.e. testing from outside the CL-CEC web-application)
        is possible once your CL-CEC is installed, configured and
        registered. You can then drive the CL-CEC and its applications from the normal 
        science UIs. </p>
      <p> AstroGrid recommends the AstroGrid "workbench" for testing. Please see the
        separate documentation for that component. The workbench allows
        you to address the CL-CEC directly, independently of scripts and workflows.
        You can also run tests by submitting workflows from the an AstroGrid
        web-portal. </p>
      <p> The exact test-cases depend on the applications for which your CL-CEC
        is configured, so no details can be given here. Good luck! </p>
