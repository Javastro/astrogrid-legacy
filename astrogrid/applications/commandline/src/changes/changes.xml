      <action dev="gtr" type="add" issue="2320">
        <p>
          If an application ends in the ERROR phase, a result (like an output
          parameter but not registered as part of the application) called
          cea-error reports the reasons. This result is shown in the UI.

      <action dev="gtr" type="update" issue="2305">
        <p>
          Many dependencies have been updated.

      <action dev="gtr" type="add" issue="2211">
        <p>
          Queuing of jobs is implemented, with a time-out imposed on
          individual jobs. By default, up to five jobs execute in parallel,
          with the rest queued, and jobs time out one day after start of
          execution. Both parameters are configurable.

      <action dev="gtr" type="add" issue="2207">
        <p>
          VOSI is implemented: the service metadata and availability may be
          read.
        </p>
      </action>
      <action dev="gtr" type="fix" issue="2077">
        <p>
          If an application returns a bad status, times out, or is aborted,
          then no attempt is made to write back the output parameters. This
          should make the server logs easier to understand.
