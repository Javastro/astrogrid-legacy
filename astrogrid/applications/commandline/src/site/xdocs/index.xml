	<body>
		<section name="Overview">
			<p> This component provides a Common Execution Connector web-service for command-line
				applications (CL-CEC for short). The CL-CEC makes astronomy applications available to the
				virtual observatory; notably, it makes them visible to AstroGrid's web portal, desktop UI
				and workflow system.</p>
			<p> Suitable applications for this kind of CEC (there are other kinds) can be run from the
				command line, have no graphical interface, and need no user interaction once launched. These
				are some of the applications already in use in AstroGrid. </p>
			<ul>
				<li>SExtractor</li>
				<li>HyperZ</li>
				<li>BPZ</li>
				<li>Pegase</li>
				<li>Galaxev</li>
			</ul>
			<p> You should install this component if you wish to allow virtual-observatory users to run
				selected applications on your computer. You choose the applications that may be run.
				You must obtain and install these applications; they are not supplied with the CL-CEC.
				The applications will run on the computer where you install
				the service, and you must provide sufficent resources (CPU, memory, disc space) for the
				applications to run efficiently. </p>
			<p> If your application is to serve archive data then this may not be the ideal component. You
				should look first at the Data Set Access (DSA) component of AstroGrid. It is possible to use
				the command-line CEC as an archive interface, but the DSA component provides better support
				for archive queries. </p>
			<p> If your application has a web interface instead of a command-line interface then you
				should not use this component but should use instead the HTTP-CEC component of AstroGrid
				(but only if the interface is based on the HTTP-get protocol; HTTP-post is not supported).
				If the application has both command-line and web interfaces then you can use either of the
				two components. </p>
			<subsection name="Internal web-pages and local controls">
				<p>
					The CEC web-application contains a copy of these web-pages. If you install the web
					application as, say, <i>CEC-1</i> on server <i>my.cea.server</i> on port <i>8081</i>,
					then the internal web pages are at
				</p>
				<pre>
http://my.cea.server:8081/CEC-1/
				</pre>
				<p>	
					The internal copy of the pages
					has, in its sidebar, extra links leading to local controls for configuration, testing and
					registration. Therefore, while setting up the CEC, you should look at the internal pages.
					If you can't find the controls, you're probably reading the web pages on 
					<i>software.astrogrid.org</i> instead.
