  <section name="Required registrations">
  	<p>
	    To make your CEC useful in the IVO, you must register, in an
	    IVOA-compliant resource registry, the CEC as a service. You do not
	    need to register applications for the HTTP CEC.
    </p>
  	<p>
		  The service registration states the service endpoint (the URL for access)
		  and lists the applications that the CEC can run. For each registration,
		  you submit a resource document (an XML file) stating the necessary metadata
		  in a machine-readable format.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		  You have a choice: either prepare and submit your resource documents manually,
		  or let the CEC register itself automatically on your behalf. AstroGrid
		  recommends automatic registration, but see the notes on mirroring applications,
	  	below.
  	</p>
  </section>

	<section name="Mirroring applications">	
		<p>
			Any HTTP-CEC can run any HTTP application that is pre-registered in the IVO
			registry. This mirroring is automatic and doesn't depend on local configuration.
			If you use automatic registration, your CEC will register itself to run all
			the HTTP applications that were registered at that point in time. This is
			the recommended arrangement. However, if you want to restrict the set of
			applications that you offer, then you should use manual registration.
		</p>
	</section>
	
  <section name="Automatic registration">
  	<p>
  		First, check the content of the registration using the "show registration document"
  		link in the side-bar. If the content isn't right, go back to the configuration
  		stage and fix it.
  	</p>
  	<p>
  		Second, make sure that your CEC is working properly, using the self-test
  		features. If it isn't working, go back to configuration and find out why.
  	</p>
  	<p>
  		Remember: registration <em>publishes</em> your resources into the IVO and
  		invites science users to depend on them. It is best not to register until
  		everything is right.
  	</p>
	  <p>
		  Use the "register" link from the sidebar. This generates the 
		  resource documents and submits them to the configured publishing-registry. 
	  </p>
  </section>
	
  <section name="Manual registration">
  	<p>
  		Most registries have a web-browser interface whereby you can submit 
  		resource documents manually. Typically, and especially in the AstroGrid
  		implementation of the registry, you upload the registration documents
  		from files on disc.
  	</p>
  	<p>
  		You can get a registration document using the "show registration document"
  		link in the sidebar. Save this to disc and edit it as necessary. You need
  		to be very careful not to "break" the structure of the document. Refer to
  		the registration template in your configuration directory for advice on
  		what to write.
  	</p>
  	<p>
  		In the special case of restricting the set of applications, you should edit
  		the registration document produced by the CEC to remove the unwanted applications.
  		In the service description, find the <i>cea:ManagedApplications</i> element.
  		Delete from this all the <i>cea:ApplicationReference</i> elements except the
  		ones for the applications you want to run in this CEC.
  	</p>

<section name="Deregistering obsolete resources">
	
	<subsection name="Ceasing service of an application">
	  <p>
		  If you want to cease service of an application, then you should update the list 
		  of managed applications in the service registration of your CEC. Do this by
		  changing the configuration - see the manual-registration section, above
		  - and repeating the registration of the CEC as described above. This states to the IVO
		  that your own CEC no longer provides the application. It doesn't eliminate the
		  registered description of the application; thus you can do this whether or not
	  	you originally registered the application and whether or not other services are
	  	offerring the same application.
	  </p>
	</subsection>
	
	<subsection name="Unregistering an application">
		<p>
			Unregistering an application removes it from the IVO resource-register causing 
			the IVO to forget its details. You must do this if you control the 
			application implementation - i.e. the HTTP service that the HTTP-CECs call -
			and you are taking it out of service permanently.
		</p>
		<p>
			To deregister an application, use the controls for the registry; you can't do this
			from the CEC's local controls. The exact technique varies between registry 
			implementations, but typically you set the <i>status</i> attribute of the
			registration to "deleted".
		</p>
	</subsection>
	
	<subsection name="Deregistering the CEC service">
 	  <p>
		  If you want to withdraw your CEC from service permanently or for a lengthy period 
 	  	(but not just for short down-time), then you should deregister it. You do this by 
 	  	editing the service resource-document, changing the value of the <i>status</i> 
 	  	attribute on the <i>Resource</i> element to "deleted" and re-registering it, 
 	  	as described above, under the same identifier.
