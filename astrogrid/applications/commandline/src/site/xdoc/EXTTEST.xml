<section name="External testing"><p>
	External testing  (i.e. testing from outside the CEC web-application)
	is possible once your CEC is installed, configured and
	registered. You can then drive the CEC and its applications from the normal 
	science UIs. 
</p>
	<p>
		AstroGrid recommends the AstroGrid "workbench" for testing. Please see the
		separate documentation for that component. The workbench allows
		you to address the CEC directly, independently of scripts and workflows.
		You can also run tests by submitting workflows from the an AstroGrid
		web-portal.
	</p>
	<p>
		The exact test-cases depend on the applications for which your CEC
		is configured, so no details can be given here. Good luck!
