      <section name="Introduction">
         <p>To utilise the CEC capabilities to the full you will need
            to configure the container to be able to use TLS/HTTPS.
            There are two main reasons for wanting to configure security
         </p>
         <ol>
            <li>To be able to interact with other services requiring
               security - the most likely of these being VOSpace</li>
            <li>The CEC itself can be configured to only allow
               authorised users to run jobs</li>
         </ol>
         <p>It is perfectly possible to run a CEC without configuring
            security as detailed on this page, but then it will only be
            able to interact with other non-secure services and be open
            to all callers.</p>

      <section name="TLS">
         <p>Transport layer security (TLS) is the name for the
            general approach of ensuring that HTTP communications are
         </p>
         <ol>
            <li>Encrypted</li>
            <li>Authenticated - at the server, and
               optionally the client end</li>
         </ol>
         <p> - this is typically known as "enabling HTTPS".</p>
