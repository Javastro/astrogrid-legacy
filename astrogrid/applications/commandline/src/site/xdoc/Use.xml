         <p>
            This server provides a dual interface for using the remotely
            defined applications, and it it possible, though perhaps not
            recommended, to control a single job with either interface.</p>
            <subsection name="SOAP services">
            <p>
               The SOAP interface is the so called CEA Common Execution
               Connector interface defined by this
               <a
                  href="http://software.astrogrid.org/schema/cea/CommonExecutionConnector/v1.0/CommonExecutionConnector.wsdl"
               >WSDL</a>
               and described in this
               <a href="http://www.ivoa.net/Documents/latest/CEA.html">IVOA Note</a>
               . It is possible to write a custom application to access
               this web service with any standard SOAP toolkit. However,
               we recommend that you use one of the clients listed
               below.</p>
            </subsection>
            <subsection name="UWS">
            <p>
               The server also supports a Universal Worker Service (UWS)
               REST style interface described on the
               <a
                  href="http://www.ivoa.net/internal/IVOA/AsynchronousHome/UWS-0.4.pdf"
               >IVOA Site</a>
               . This is generally easier to drive than the SOAP
               interface, making it possible to use, for example, a web
               browser to interact with a UWS service. This CEC has a
               basic web interface for interacting with UWS built-in,
               and accessible via the side-menus.</p>
               <dl>
                  <dt><a href="../app/chooseapp.jsp"  class="ceconly">Test run of application</a></dt>
                  <dd>This allows the installed applications to be
                     run in a simple fashion via a web form. After the
                     application parameters are set a job is created in
                     the UWS system.</dd>
                  <dt><a href="../uws/jobs"  class="ceconly">UWS root</a></dt>
                  <dd>This is the root of the UWS system as defined
                     in the IVOA Standard. The initial URL gives a list
                     of jobs known to the CEC, which links to each job
                     to allow further control such as aborting or
                     deleting the job.</dd>

               The recommended client for this CEC is the
               <a href="http://www.astrogrid.org/wiki/Home/AboutAGDesktop">Astrogrid VODesktop</a>
               .
            </p>
            <p>This client not only provides a GUI for running the
               applications on the CEC, but also provides support for
               all of the interacting services that make up the Virtual
               Observatory - for example discovery and security are
               handled seamlessly.</p>
            <p>The VODesktop also provides a programmatic interface to
               access all aspects of the VO via the AstroRuntime.</p>

         <subsection name="Java client">
            <p>Astrogrid supplies a <a href="http://software.astrogrid.org/doc/latest/cea/client/">Java client</a> for the SOAP
               service that deals with creating a authenticated SOAP
               connection to the server.</p>
