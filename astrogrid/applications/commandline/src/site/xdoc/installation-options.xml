		<p>This document discusses alternatives to the the standard installation.</p>
		
	<subsection name="Alternative versions of SUN Java">
   
	<p>Versions of SUN Java older than 1.5 will not run the web-application
	properly in all respects.</p>
	<p>We expect SUN Java 6 to work as well as SUN Java 5 for this
	web-application. We have not fully tested this configuration yet.</p>
	</subsection>
		<subsection name="Alternative implementations of Java">
		<p>You may use another implementation of Java, provided that it
		is a complete implementation of the Java platform. Some Java 
                implementations omit some library classes and these are likely
		to cause serious problems. In particular, the <i>Kaffe</i>
		implementation of java, which is included in many Linux
		distributions, currently lacks some classes and cannot run this
		web-application.</p>
		</subsection>
	<subsection name="Alternative versions of Tomcat">
          <p>You may use Tomcat 6.0 in place of Tomcat 5.5 
          At the time of writing we have not tested the web-application with
          Tomcat 6.</p>
	</subsection>
	<subsection name="Alternative web containers">
          <p>You might use a web container other than Tomcat. We have not
          tested this web-application in any other containers and cannot
          support such a configuration. However, you might find one that
          works well.</p>
