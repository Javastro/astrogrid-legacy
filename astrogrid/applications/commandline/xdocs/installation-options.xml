		<p>This document discusses alternatives to the the standard installation.</p>
		
		<section name="Alternative web containers">
			<p>
			The standard installation requires Jakarta-Tomcat, at v5.0.19 for a production-network service and v5.0.28
				of a development-network service. Other containers, and other versions, of Tomcat <em>might</em> work but may
				introduce subtle errors. No other containers and versions are supported; Tomcat v5.0.28 is only supported in
				the sense that it is being used for AstroGrid's internal development.
			</p>
			<p>
				The web-application will probably not work in containers other than Tomcat. If you try one and get it to
				work, then please let the AstroGrid project know. If you try a container and hit problems, then it is
				likely that the web-application would need to be changed to run in this container. This is not a bug:
				AstroGrid components are not designed to work with other containers.
			</p>
			<p>
				Tomcat versions in the 5.0.x series can probably run the web-application. Versions after 5.0.19 are most
				likely to work.
			</p>
			<p>
				Tomcat versions in the 5.5.x series cannot run the web-application when Tomcat runs with Java 1.5; this
				has been shown empirically. Tomcat 5.5.x reconfigured for Java 1.4.x might work.
			</p>
			<p>
				Tomcat versions in the 4.1.x series might work.
			</p>
			<p>
				Tomcat versions in the 3.x series cannot run the web-application. They support an older edition of
				the servlet standard; the web-application requires servlet v2.3.
