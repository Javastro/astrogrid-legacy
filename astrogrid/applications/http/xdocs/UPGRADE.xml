	This page describes how to install a new version of AstroGrid's HTTP-CEC
	component while retaining the configuration from your previous version.
	The procedure is:
</p>
	<ol>
		<li>preserve the existing configuration in a safe place
			(see the <a href="CONFIGURE.html">configuration guide</a>);</li>
		<li>delete the existing version of the web-application;
		(see the <a href="UNINSTALL.html">uninstallaion guide</a>)</li>
		<li>install the new version of the web-application
			(see the <a href="INSTALL.html">installation guide</a>);</li>
		<li>restore the old configuration to the new version
			(see the <a href="CONFIGURE.html">configuration guide</a>).</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		There are many other tricks with Tomcat and web-applications for changing the software
		while retaining the configuration. Most of them do not work consistently, and the ones
		that do work need external tools and infrastructure. I recommend strongly that you
		use the procedure above for upgrades.
