			<p> The HTTP-CEC web-application includes web-pages and those pages include test functions. To
				get at the web pages, go with your web browser to a URL made up of the address of your
				server computer and the context path of the web-application. E.g. 
				<pre>
http://your.server.address:8080/HTTP-CEC-1/
				</pre>
			</p>
			<subsection name="Testing Axis">
				<p> The HTTP-CEC contains the Apache Axis technology for web services. If Axis is not working,
					then the CEC does not work. You should test Axis as soon as you have the HTTP-CEC installed. </p>
				<p>Run the Axis tests using the "axis check" command from the left-hand side-bar. </p>
				<p> The test checks for the presence of JARs of code. You need all the core libraries to be
					present; the optional libraries are not required. </p>
				<img src="axis-happy.gif" alt="Screen-shot of successful Axis test."/>
				<p> If Axis is not happy, there are three possibilities.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>The WAR for the web-application may be faulty. Please report a bug to AstroGrid.</li>
					<li>You may have Axis-related parts installed in your copy of Tomcat. Check the
					common directories of Tomcat for any JARs with similar names to those in the HTTP-CEC
						web-application.</li>
					<li>Your copy of Java may be broken or may be inapproriate for the HTTP-CEC. Please make sure 
						that you are using Java 1.4.x and not Java 1.5.x. Check for any JAR files added to the 
					  Java installation that may be subverting the web-application.</li>
				</ul>I
			</subsection>
			<subsection name="Testing the installations">
				<p> When you have the HTTP-CEC configured you can test the configuration using the <i>installation test</i>
					command from the left-hand side-bar. This does not test the registration of applications for
					which your HTTP-CEC acts as proxy.
