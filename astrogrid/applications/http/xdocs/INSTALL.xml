		<section name="Installation">
		<p>This document describes the standard installation. Please see the reference guide for
			possible variations.</p>
		</section>
		
		<section name="Prerequisites">
			<subsection name="Web container (Jakarta-Tomcat)">
			<p> You must install Jakarta-Tomcat: this is the only supported container for the
				web-application. AstroGrid recommends Tomcat v5.0.28. V5.5.x is not suitable.
			</p>
			</subsection>
			<subsection name="Tomcat roles">
			<p> You will need to use Tomcat's administration features to configure the web-application.
				You should configure Tomcat with a local user-name that has the <i>admin</i> 
				and <i>manager</i> roles.</p>
			</subsection>
			<subsection name="Naming the web-application context">
				<p>
					You must choose a name for the "context" in which the web-application runs. This name will 
					become part of the URLs for your HTTP-CEC web-service and the web pages of your HTTP-CEC web-application. 
					E.g., if you name the web-application context "HTTP-CEC-1", the URLs will be of the form <pre>
http://your.server.address:8080/HTTP-CEC-1/
http://your.server.address:8080/HTTP-CEC-1/services/CommonExecutionConnectorService </pre>
					respectively.
				</p>
			</subsection>
		</section>
		<section name="Related components">
			<subsection name="FileStore">
				<p> Your HTTP-CEC works with AstroGrid's <i>FileManager</i> component to read and write files in
					VOSpace. The details of which stores to use are set by the clients of the web-application
					in requests to the CEC web-service. You do not need to supply your own FileManager to operate
					the HTTP-CEC web-application. </p>
			</subsection>
			<subsection name="Registry">
				<p> Your web application uses an IVOA resource-registry to publicize its capabilities. You
					must have access to a registry in which you can publish your resources and a registry from
					which your HTTP-CEC web-application can search for its registration at run-time. </p>
				<p> The publishing registry and the searchable registry may be the same service. In this
					case, you will typically use an external registry. As an alternative, you may choose to
					run a local publishing registry. This makes it easier to publish and maintain groups of
					services on your site and also helps you establish a "brand" for your services by
					associating them with your own publishing authority. If you want to run a publishing
					registry, then you should install and set up the AstroGrid registry component
					<em>before</em> setting up your HTTP-CEC. </p>
			</subsection>
		</section>
		<section name="Installation procedure">
				<ol>
				<li>Obtain a copy of the WAR file for the HTTP-CEC from the AstroGrid software site. See the
					<a href="DOWNLOAD.html">guide to downloading</a> for details. </li>
				<li>Rename the WAR file to match the chosen name of the web-application context; e.g.
					HTTP-CEC-1.war if the context is HTTP-CEC-1 as in the example above. </li>
				<li>Copy your renamed WAR file into the <i>webapps</i> sub-directory of your Tomcat
					installation. Wait a few seconds. Tomcat notices the WAR file, unpacks the web-application
					into a sub-directory tree in the <i>webapps</i> directory and starts the
					web-application.</li>
				<li>
					Check that the web-application has started correctly by going, with a web-browser, to the
					root of the web application (http://your.server.address:8080/HTTP-CEC-1/ in the example above).
					If no web-page is returned, then there is a problem with the WAR.
				</li>
				<li>Now set up your web-application by following the instructions in the configuration guide.</li>
				</ol>
