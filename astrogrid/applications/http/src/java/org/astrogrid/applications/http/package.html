		<h1>Http CEA Applications.</h1>
		<p>This package provides the main classes for wrapping  http-get
			and http-post applications such as SIAP services.  It follows the same
			design as the {@link org.astrogrid.applications.commandline} and {@link org.astrogrid.applications.javaclass}
			packages.  The {@link org.astrogrid.applications.http.HttpApplicationDescriptionLibrary} talks to the Registry and maintains
			a library of suitable http-apps, which it encapsulates as {@link org.astrogrid.applications.http.HttpApplicationDescription}s.  A {@link org.astrogrid.applications.http.HttpApplicationDescription}
			in turn	creates a {@link org.astrogrid.applications.http.HttpApplication} which controls the execution of the application.  Communication with the remote web server
			that actually provides the service is via the {@link org.astrogrid.applications.http.HttpServiceClient}.
