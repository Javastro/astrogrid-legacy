         Replace "ServiceName" with a name for your service that is 
         unique for that authority ID. You can use forward slashes
         in the service name to imply hierarchical naming: e.g.
         INT-WFS/images/broad-band.  Note that this name applies to
         the service, not to an individual application. Most CEC services
         run a mixed bag of applications so need fairly generic names. -->
