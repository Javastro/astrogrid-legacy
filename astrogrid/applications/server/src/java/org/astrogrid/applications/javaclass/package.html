		<h1>Simplest possible implementation of CEA</h1>
		cea implementation that calls (static) methods on java classes.
		this implementation might be of some use in deployment, but is primarily for development / testing
	 <p>
	 	This package could be used to provide standard 'helper applications' at each cea / jes server - e.g. the 'send mail' application
	 	still needs a bit of work - 
	 	<ul>
	 		<li>reflecting parameter types - currently everything is called 'string'</li>
	 		<li>should be able to export methods in more than one static class at the same time</li>
	 		<li>should have a way of providing the description information not available via reflection alone (e.g. ucds, documentation) - 
	 			possible methods
	 			<ul>
	 				<li>either reading a separate configuration file (blergh), </li>
	 				<li>metadata in source (like bean descriptors)</li>, 
	 				<li>or attributes of the source file (nanning, jakarta attributes,xdoclet even)</li>
	 				</ul>
	 				</li>
	 		</ul>
