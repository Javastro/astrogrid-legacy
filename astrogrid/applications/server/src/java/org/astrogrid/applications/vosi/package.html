  <p>Classes implementing the IVOA "VO Support Interfaces" (VOSI) standard.</p>
  
  <h2>Package Specification</h2>
  <p>
    VOSI specifies that each service should provide two pages of XML,
    one describing the service in terms of Capability elements and the other
    stating the service availability. The URIs for these web-resources are
    not fixed in the standard but are chosen by the service implementor and
    registered.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the AstroGrid, CEA implementation, the URIs are /VOSI/capabilities
    and /VOSI/availability; i.e. the REST binding of VOSI is used. These
    URIs should be mapped to the VosiServlet provided in this package. The
    servlet sets as request attributes (NB: attributes not parameters) the
    data needed to complete the VOSI responses and forwards the request to
    one of the JSPs /VOSI/capabilities.jsp and /VOSI/availability.jsp to
    generate the XML. When the servlet is configured into a web application,
    it should mapped to the absolute paths /VOSI/capabilities
    and /VOSI/availability. If, instead, it were mapped to /VOSI/*, then the
    forwarding to the JSPs would not work.
  </p>
  <p>
    The JSPs have to be provided separately, in the web-application where VOSI
    is installed.
  </p>
  <p>
    The servlet sets attributes as needed for the application servers. If a
    different set of attributes is needed (e.g. for DSA), then a sub-class of
    VosiServlet should be made in which the method setAttributes() is overridden.
