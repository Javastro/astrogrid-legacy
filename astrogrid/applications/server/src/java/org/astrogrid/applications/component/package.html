		<h1>Component Assembly and Management</h1>
		This package contains the framework that assembles the different components of cea into a cea server.
		Depending on the components used, and the way they are confgured, different kinds of server can be produced, 
		while still reusing large amounts of code.
		<p />
		The core class is {@link CEAComponentManagerFactory} - a static singleton that is responsible for selecting (via config)
		a class to instantiate that defines the components in the server. 
		The instantiated class must implement the {@link CEAComponentManager} interface.
