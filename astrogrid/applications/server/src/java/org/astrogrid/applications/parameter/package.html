		<h1>Managing and Manpulating parameter values</h1>
		This class defines the abstraction of a {@link ParameterAdapter} - an abstract way of handling parameters as
		they are marshalled in and out of the application.
		
		<p />
		This package provides a default implementation that provides all parameters as in-memory strings, and 
		utility code for working with indirect parameters - i.e. those passed by reference to an external resource, which has to be 
		retreived to gain the parameter value itself.
