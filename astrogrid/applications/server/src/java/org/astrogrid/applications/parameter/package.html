		<h1>Managing and Manpulating parameter values</h1>
		This class defines the abstraction of a {@link ParameterAdapter} - which privides a uniform way of handling parameters as
		they are marshalled in and out of the application.
		
		<p />
		This package provides a default implementation that provides all parameters as in-memory strings, and 
		utility code for working with indirect parameters - i.e. those passed by reference to an external resource, which has to be 
		retreived to gain the parameter value itself. Handlers for accessing external resources by a variety of different protocols are defined in the 
		{@link org.astrogrid.applications.parameter.protocol} package.
