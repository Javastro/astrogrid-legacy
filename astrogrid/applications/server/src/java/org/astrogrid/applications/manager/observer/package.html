		<h1>Observer implementations that like to watch applications do stuff</h1>
		{@link org.astrogrid.applications.AbstractApplication} extends the {@link java.util.Observable} class. Through this, interested 
		observers can register with an applicaiton, and then receive notifications of events.
		<p>
		The <tt>Observer</tt> / <tt>Observable</tt> framework is quite untyped - {@link java.lang.Object} values are passed around.
		This package defines two abstract classes that may be extended to listen to particular types of events from an application in a type-safe way.
		This package also provides a concrete extension of each abstract class that propagates the event notification on to a remote web-service listener interface.
