    <body><H1>Metadata about an application</H1>
    	
    		<p>This package contains code for describing the applications that are provided by the server.</p>
        <p>The overall description of the application is defined by the {@link org.astrogrid.applications.description.ApplicationDescription} class - it defines the application's
        name (used as the unique key for retreival), description, and the interfaces it supports.
                        
        <p>In CEA usage, an <i>interface</i> is a set of input and output parameters that an application may be validly invoked with.
        An application may provide more than one interface - e.g. it may have 'standard' and 'advanced' sets of parameters. Each interface of 
        an <tt>ApplicationDescription</tt> is represented by an instance of   {@link org.astrogrid.applications.description.ApplicationInterface}.
        This defines the inteface name, description, and most importantly the parameter set it requires.
        
        <p>
        Each parameter of an application is represented by an instance of  {@link org.astrogrid.applications.description.ParameterDescription} .
        This class defines the minimum metadata required for a parameter - its name and basic type. Further optional metadata may be provided, for use in 
        workflow-building tools - e.g.. default values, units, UCD, documentaiton, valid encodings, etc.
        
            <p>
            	One or more <tt>ApplicationDescriptions<tt> are contained within a {@link org.astrogrid.applications.description.ApplicationDescriptionLibrary},
            	from which they can be retreived by name.
            <p>
            This package provides two implementations of <tt>ApplicationDescriptionLibrary</tt> - together they form a kind of composite pattern - a set of related application
            descriptions can be contained wihin a (subclass of) {@link org.astrogrid.applications.description.BaseApplicationDescriptionLibrary}; while the 
            {@link org.astrogrid.applications.description.CompositeApplicationDescriptionLibrary} provides a unified view over a collection of application description libraries
