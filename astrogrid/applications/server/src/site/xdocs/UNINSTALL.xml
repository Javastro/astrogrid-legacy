		You should deregister any resource for which you intend to cease service.
		For the CEC you should
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li><em>definitely</em> deregister the service;</li>
		<li><em>possibly</em> deregister the applications.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		You should only deregister the applications if you originally registered them and if
		no other application is providing those applications.
	</p>
	<p>
		In each case, deregistration means that you edit a resource document in the registry, changing
		its status to "deleted". Please refer to the 
		<a href="REGISTER.html">registration guide</a> for instructions.
