<!-- This file provides templates for the registration of a 
	   Common Execution Connector (CEC) service and its applications.
	   The template contains CeaApplicationType and CeaServiceType 
	   resource-documents. The CEC will read this file and combine the
	   contents with information from its local configuration.
	
	   The person setting up the CEC must make an edited copy of this template
	   with some of the metadata filled in. At the very least, the identitier
	   elements - i.e. the formal names of the service and applications in the
	   registry - must be set correctly as they cannot be changed after 
	   registration.
	
	   The valid customizations are described in the comments below. In general, you
	   need to set the values that will be read by humans; the stuff that is read
	   by machines will be filled in by the CEC itself. Beware of changing the
	   structure of the template; the parser is very picky! Don't change the
	   namespace prefices!
