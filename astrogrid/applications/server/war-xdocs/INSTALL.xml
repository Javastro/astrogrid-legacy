<p>The basic install medium is a war file called applications-integration.war, which can be found at</p>

<a href="http://cvs.astrogrid.org/maven/org.astrogrid/wars/astrogrid-applications-SNAPSHOT.war">http://cvs.astrogrid.org/maven/org.astrogrid/wars/astrogrid-applications-SNAPSHOT.war</a>

<p>The war requires Tomcat 4.1.24 or higher running under JVM 1.4 or higher</p>

<p>To do the inital install of the application it needs simply to be added into $TOMCAT_HOME/webapps directory and start tomcat.
This will install the basic files required to run the service along with some example configuration files as well as a test application.
