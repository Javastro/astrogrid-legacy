The basic install medium is a war file called applications-integration.war, which can be found at

http://cvs.astrogrid.org/maven/astrogrid-applications/wars/astrogrid-applications.war

The war requires Tomcat 4.1.24 or higher running under JVM 1.4 or higher

To do the inital install of the application it needs simply to be added into $TOMCAT_HOME/webapps directory and start tomcat.
This will install the basic files required to run the service along with some example configuration files as well as a test application.

At this point you can obtain more information by looking at the web site itself

http://localhost:8080/astrogrid-applications/

where detailed explanations of the confuration steps are contained. In summary you need to

  1 configure a database to store the management information that the application controller needs.
  2  configure two JNDI resources in tomcat
     * jdbc/AstrogridACDatasource that points to the database created in step 1
     * AstrogridApplicationsConfigURL is a URL that points to a file that contains the main configuration data for the application
      controller including another pointer to a file that describes the actual applications that the controller manages.
