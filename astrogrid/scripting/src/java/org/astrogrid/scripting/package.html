	<H1>Astrogrid Scripting Toolbox</H1>
	This package draws code together from various astrogrid delegate libraries and helper classes. This makes the main 
	functionality of astrogrid easy to use from scripting languages - a root object is created, and all other functionality can
	be accessed through it.
	<p />
	The root object of the scripting model is implemented by the {@link org.astrogrid.scripting.Toolbox} class. How the root object
	is created depends upon the scripting language used.

<h2>Features of Toolbox</h2>
		  
		  
<h2>Deprecated classes</h2>
The {@link org.astrogrid.scripting.Services} and {@link org.astrogrid.scripting.Astrogrid} classes are previous designs for Toolbox that also include 
service discovery. This was based on an xml config file, which isn't the way to do things - we should be querying the registry instead.
