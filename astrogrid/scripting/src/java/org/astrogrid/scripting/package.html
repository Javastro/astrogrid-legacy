	<H1>Astrogrid Scripting</H1>
	This package draws code together from various astrogrid delegate libraries and helper classes. This makes the main 
	functionality of astrogrid easy to use from scripting languages - a root object is created, and all other functionality can
	be accessed through it.
	<p />
	The root object of the scripting model is implemented by the {@link org.astrogrid.scripting.Astrogrid} class. How the root object
	is created depends upon the scripting language used.
