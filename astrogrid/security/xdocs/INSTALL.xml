      <p>
      The facade is supplied as a jar of classes to be used in client
      and server applications. The astrogrid/security component does not
      generate a web application in a war file.
      </p>
  
      <p>
      To use the facade, download astrogrid-security-(version).jar, or
      set Maven to download it from the repository on www.astrogrid.org.
      You will also need the following jars from AstroGrid:
      </p>
  
      <ul>
        <li>astrogrid-common</li>
        <li>astrogrid-community-client</li>
        <li>astrogrid-community-common</li>
        <li>astrogrid-community-resolver</li>
        <li>astrogrid-registry-client</li>
        <li>astrogrid-registry-common</li>
      </ul>
  
      <p>
      In addition, your application must include the following third-party jars:
      </p>
  
      <ul>
        <li>saaj</li>
        <li>axis</li>
        <li>jaxrpc-api</li>
        <li>wsdl4j (at v1.0)</li>
       </ul>
  
      <p>
      See the dependencies list for this package for full details.
