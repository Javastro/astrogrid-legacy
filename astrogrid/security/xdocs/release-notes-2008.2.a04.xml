    <section name="Release notes for security facade 2008.2.a04">
      <p>
        V2008.2.a04 is the fourth alpha version in the development leading
        to the 2008.2 release. This version eliminates the dependency on
        several third-=party jars
      </p>
      
      <subsection name="Revised validator for certificates chains">
        <p>
          Versions of the security facade up to and including 2008.2.a03
          used the class <i>org.globus.gsi.proxy.ProxyPathValidator</i>
          to validate certifcates chains. That class entrains many 3rd-party
          jars (puretls; cryptix).
        </p>
        <p>
          A new class, <i>org.astrogrid.security.rfc3820.ProxyCertPathReviewer</i>
          has been added to replace the Globus validator. It is based on a
          validator from the Bouncy-Castle package, adding to the latter
          support for proxy certificates. This validator is wrapped in a
          revision of the existing class 
          <i>org.astrogrid.security.rfc3820.CertificateChainValidator</i> which
          in turn has some new methods and some new deprecations.
