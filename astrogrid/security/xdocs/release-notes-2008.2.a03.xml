    <section name="Release notes for security facade 2008.2.a03">
      <p>
        V2008.2.a03 is the third alpha version in the development leading
        to the 2008.2 release. This version refactors existing code and adds
        a few interfaces in support of the AR.
      </p>
      
      <subsection name="Old classes refactored">
        <p>
          <i>org.astrogrid.security.AccountIvorn</i> takes over from
          <i>org.astrogrid.security.community.CommunityIvornParser</i>;
          the latter is dropped from the facade. The <i>AccountIvorn</i>
          class, which was already present in a limited form, now parses
          its value and its constructors enforce validity. There are new
          accessors to get the IVORN for the community, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>org.astrogrid.security.community.RegistryClient</i> takes over
          from <i>org.astrogrid.security.community.CommunityEndpointResolver</i>.
          The former is much simpler than the latter and is not at all specific
          to the community services. This simpler form seems to be sufficient
          for all uses within the facade.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>org.astrogrid.security.SecurityGuard</i> no longer throws a plain
          <i>Exception</i>. It now always throws a specific kind of exception.
          This is a result of the refactoring.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>org.astrogrid.security.SecurityGuard</i> has a new accessor
          <i>getAccountIvorn()</i>.
