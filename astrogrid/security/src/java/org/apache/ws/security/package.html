<p>
This package tree is a fragment of Apache WSS4J. Only the classes necessary for
digital signature work are included (WSS4J covers many other uses of WS-Security).
Of those classes, a few are included in the form provided by Apache but some are
altered to suit AstroGrid's use cases. Thus, it is more convenient to include the
WSS4J classes in the build and artifacts of astrogrid-security than to house them
in their own jar.
