Digital signatures on SOAP messages. This is a facade for
parts of Apache WSS4J (which deal with the WS-security header-format) and
parts the Java CoG kit (which deal with chains of trust).
</p>
<p>
The <i>Uther</i> class is a wart caused by the use of Apache WSS4J. It is a replacement
for the <i>Merlin</i> class in that package that does not force the use of disc files
to store credentials. It should not be used by classes outside this package.
</p>
<p>
The classes in this package support the main security-facade but are not part of it.
They should not be used directly by applications.
