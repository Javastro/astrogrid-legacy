    Clients for the AstroGrid community services.
  </p>
  <p>
    SsoClient is the client for the Astrogrid "accounts" protocol, 
    versions 1 and 2. This protocol allows a user to sign on at a community
    service, using a password and to receive a certificate chain. In the v2
    protocol, the user's home-space may be discovered from the service.
  </p>
  <p>
    The other classes in the package support the use of SsoClient.
  </p>
  <p>
    This package is best accessed via the signOn method in SecurityGuard.
    Applications should not call these classes directly.
