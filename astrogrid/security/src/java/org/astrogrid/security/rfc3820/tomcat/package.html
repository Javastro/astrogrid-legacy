  <p>An SSL implementation for Tomcat that
    understands RFC3820. When authenticating clients, it 
  accepts proxy certificates conforming to RFC3820.</p>
  
  <p>RFC3820 only concerns the handling of extensions in the certificates:
    it allows a certificate to appear part-way up a chain without being marked 
    up as a CA certificate. The cryptography is not affected; only the
    trust manager needs to be changed. Therefore, this implementation builds
    on the JSSE implementation normally used by Tomcat 5.5. It patches the
    creation of server sockets, by replacing the socket-factory class, in order
  to impose a better trust-manager.</p>
