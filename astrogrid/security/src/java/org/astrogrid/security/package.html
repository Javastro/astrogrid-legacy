<h1>
Secure messaging and control of access to resources
for web services and their clients.
</h1>

<p>
'Secure messaging' means that messages to and from services
are protected against tampering (e.g. by digital signature),
or made confidential (e.g. by encryption) or made proof against
misuse (e.g. by using security contexts to prevent an attacker
replaying captured messages). 'Access control' means that the
identity of the the sender of the message is checked and made
known to the service and that use of a service is checked
against recorded policy.
</p>

<p>
The classes are in two groups: <code>SecurityGuard</code>
and its sub-classes; Axis message-handlers.
Applications only make
direct calls to the <code>SecurityGuard</code> variants; the
other classes are called from within the framework.
</p>

<p>
A <code>SecurityGuard</code> is a Java bean whose properties
represent credentials. The basic bean is simply an abstract
way of passing credentials between objects inside one JVM;
it has no methods for manipulating or using the credentials.
</p>

<p>
The <code>AxisClientSecurityGuard</code> extends <code>SecurityGuard</code>
with code for passing credentials to an Axis handler. It depends
internally on APIs from Axis and WSS4J. A client should use the static method
<code>getEngineConfiguration</code> to configure an instance of
<code>org.apache.axis.client.Service</code> with the apropriate handlers.
The client should then call <code>configureStub</code> on the security
guard to pass the credentials into the handler.
</p>

<p>
<code>AxisClientCredentialHandler</code> is the handler that signs
outgoing messages. It is the user of the grid credentials.
</p>

<p>
The <code>AxisServiceSecurityGuard</code> extends <code>SecurityGuard</code>
with a factory method <code>getInstanceFromContext</code> that constructs
a guard with credentials retrieved from the authentication handler. A service
may use this to retrieve the authenticated identity of the caller.
</p>

<p>
<code>AxisServiceCredentialHandler</code> is the handler for the services.
It checks signatures on incoming messages. Services should declare handlers
of this class in their request-processing chains.
</p>

<p>
The other classes in the package should not be called directly by client code.
