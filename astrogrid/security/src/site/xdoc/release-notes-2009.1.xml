    <section name="Release notes for security facade 2009.1">
      <p>
        V2009.1 includes one new feature and some important bug-fixes.
        Application programmers should upgrade from the v2008.2 series
        as soon as possible.
      </p>

      <subsection name="Preliminary support for MyProxy">
        <p>
          It is now possible to sign on using a MyProxy service instead of
          a community accounts service. This is a preliminary release of this
          feature, lightly tested, and may not work in all circumstances.
          Please see the <a href="myproxy-sign-on.html">MyProxy</a> page
          for details.
        </p>

      <subsection name="Fixed: problems with multiple copies of credentials">
        <p>
          The facade API treats certain kinds of credential and principal
          as singletons: a signed-on user has zero or one private key,
          certificate chain, etc.
          In all versions before the 2009.1 series, the security-facade
          library failed to enforce this when security items are added to
          a <i>SecurityGuard</i>. It accepted multiple copies of each kind
          of item and returned a random selection from the set when asked
          to return a singleton. This is fixed in 2009.1. Now, each subsequent
          input of a security item overwrites the previous item of that kind.
        </p>
      </subsection>

      <subsection name="Fixed: race conditions in credential delegation">
        <p>
          In all versions before the 2009.1 series, there is a race condition
          in the implementation of the IVOA credential-delegation protocol.
          Each request to the <i>DelegationServlet</i> to start a delegation
          created a new key-pair for the given identity, over-writing the
          previous key-pair. Because the delegation protocol is not atomic,
          there was a race condition between multiple clients and the service
          extracting the delegation credentials such that the latter service
          could extract a certificate chain and private key that did not match.
          This has been fixed in 2009.1 by making the key pair immutable after
          the first delegation is started.
