    <section name="Release notes for security facade 2008.2.a01">
      <p>
        V2008.2.a01 is the first alpha version in the development leading
        to the 2008.2 release. This version introduces significant new
        functions.
      </p>
      
      <subsection name="Java 5 required">
        <p>
          Java 5 is now required; the code will not compile with Java 1.4.2.
        </p>
      </subsection>
      
      <subsection name="Client for accounts protocol v2">
        <p>
          The new <i>org.astrogrid.security.community</i> package contains
          client classes for talking to the AstroGrid community service.
          These classes are ported from the community-common and 
          community-resolver packages.
        </p>
        <p>
          The client for the AstroGrid accounts-protocol, 
          <i>SsoClient</i> handles v2 of that protocol. This means 
          that the home-space of the user may be looked up by calling the 
          <i>home</i> method on the client.
        </p>
      </subsection>
      
      <subsection name="RFC3820 support">
        <p>
          The <i>org.astrogrid.security.rfc3820</i> package gains a new class
          <i>ProxyCertificateFactory</i> that generates proxy certificates.
          This code is refactored from the community-webapp project and is
          expected to be used in later versions of that project.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <i>CertificateChainValidator</i> has a new method that validates
          a chain presented as <i>List&lt;X509Certificate&gt;</i>.
        </p>
      </subsection>
      
      <subsection name="maven.xml eliminated">
        <p>
          This version of the facade has no <i>maven.xml</i> file. The unit tests
          have been reworked to cope without it.
        </p>
