      <p>
        V2008.2.a06 is the sixth alpha-version in the development leading
        to the 2008.2 release. This version supports v3 of the accounts protocol.
      </p>
      
      <subsection name="Password changing">
        <p>
          This release of the facade supports the changing of a user's 
          account-password. The API is <i>SecurityGuard.changePassword()</i>,
          and it takes the URI for the source of credentials as an argument.
        </p>
        <p>
          Two kinds of credential sources allow the password to be changed.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Community accounts protocol of version 3 or later;
          the URI is the IVORN for the community, e.g.
          <i>ivo://some.university/community</i>.</li>
          <li>A Java key-store, of type JKS, held in a local file; the URI
          refers to the file, e.g. <i>file:/some/path/credentials.jks</i>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          For other sources of credentials, e.g. a key-store fetched by HTTP,
          the password cannot be changed by the security guard.
