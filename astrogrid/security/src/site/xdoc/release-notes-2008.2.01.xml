    <section name="Release notes for security facade 2008.2.01">
      <p>
        V2008.2.01 is a minor enhancement to v2008.2. It not worth upgrading
        unless you are experiencing the specific problem described below.
      </p>
      
      <subsection name="Inclusion of classes from Apache Xalan">
        <p>
          The security facade includes modified copies of classes from the
          Apache library WSS4J. These classes need one class,
          <i>org.apache.xml.utils.URI</i>, from Apache Xalan and that class
          in turns uses the package <i>org.apache.xml.res</i> which is also in
          Xalan.
        </p>
        <p>
          If an application uses the SOAP-digital-signature feature of the
          security facade and does not link in a Xalan jar, then the results
          are variable. With some JDKs, everything works as expected. With
          others, there are complaints of missing classes. See
          <a href="http://www.astrogrid.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=2827">bug 2827</a>
          for details.
        </p>
        <p>
          In general, we expect applications to use the XSLT and XPath
          implementations that come with the JDK rather than depending
          explicitly on Xalan. Therefore, the few Xalan classes needed by
          the facade are included in the facade itself and packaged in its jar.
          The code has been taken from Apache Xalan 2.7.1.
