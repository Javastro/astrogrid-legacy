README ....................................This readme file
astrogrid-adqlparser-base-2009.1.jar ......Base parser that produces XML from ADQL
astrogrid-adqlparser-sv-2009.1.jar ........Server version that manages a pool of base parsers
astrogrid-adqlparser-utils-2009.1.jar .....Basic utilities, some used in testing
astrogrid-adqlbeans-2009.1.jar ............XMLBeans generated against an AQDL schema
adqli.sh ..................................Shell script for running one of the utilities (requires editing)
log4j.properties ..........................a basic log4j properties file

For convenience, some of the major runtime dependencies have been included, which are also
available from other public sites:

jsr173_api-1.0.jar
saxon-6.5.5.jar
stax-api-1.0.1.jar
xmlbeans-2.3.0.jar
xmlbeans-qname-2.3.0.jar

Style Sheets:
=============
There are a selection of xsl style sheets included within the server version jar file.
At present they cover SqlServer, MySql, PostgreSql, Sybase and Hsqldb.

There is also one that I use in development which echoes back ADQL.
I use this with the interactive test programme (see the adqli.sh script), which allows
me to type in ADQL, parse it, and then translate it back into ADQL. It provides direct feedback.

It may be convenient to unpack (or even remove) the style sheets from the jar.
Feel free to criticize or suggest changes to these. 
There are weaknesses here from the viewpoint of depth of testing. And... 
Please forward changes and suggestions to me: Jeff Lusted [ email: jl99@star.le.ac.uk ]

Runtime Dependencies:
=====================
There are other runtime dependencies. For a complete list, see the Maven reports. 
Java 1.5.0_15 or above is required. It has not been tested yet with Java 1.6.

commons-logging 1.0.4 or later
log4j           1.2.8 or later

Script:
=======
The adqli.sh script requires editing. 
It will run a command-line conversation with the base parser.
For debugging syntax, include a log4j properties file with level set to TRACE.
