         The generated XMLBeans are used to produce the XML form of a query as emitted by the base
         ADQL parser. The whole XMLBeans framework is a powerful setup. There are factories to build every single
         part of a query. Each bean allows manipulaton of its lower level structures, and there is access to all 
         of the schema data, which is useful for introspection. There is a low level cursor architecture with the
         ability to quickly examine (modify, copy, insert, delete) parts of a query, and many useful utility 
         functions. 
       </p>
       <p>
         The cursor architecture is used in semantic checking within the ADQL base parser.
       </p>
       <p>
         The beans are particularly useful in producing a fragment of a query. For example, the base parser
         in fragment mode can process in isolation the following fragment of ADQL:
         <br/><br/>
         (a.frequency&lt;=110 AND a.frequency&gt;=100) OR (a.frequency&lt;=220 AND a.frequency&gt;=210)
         <br/><br/>
         and the fragment of XML produced can then be inserted into an existing query. This aspect is used extensively
         in the VODesktop's Query Builder.
