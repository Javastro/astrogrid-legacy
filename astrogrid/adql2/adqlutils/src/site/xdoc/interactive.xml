    	<subsection name="Base Parser">
    		<p> 
    		  The Interactive programme runs a simple command line conversation which allows ADQL to be typed in
    		  and echoes back useful information on what the parser produces.
	       </p>  
	       <p> 
    		  The basic display is a pretty print of the intermediate XML, or error messages if the parse fails
    		  for any reason. It can be augmented by passing in a style sheet, which will be applied to the XML.    		        
	       </p>
	       <p>
	          There is an option to pass in metadata so some metadata processing can be simulated.
	       </p>
	       <p>
	          Switch tracing on in Log4J for extensive tracing of the syntax call path.
	          Really useful if you are debugging syntax.

  		<subsection name="Server Version">
    		<p> 
    		  The InteractiveSV programme runs a simple command line conversation which tests out the server
    		  version which manages a pool of base parsers. It allows ADQL to be typed
    		  in and echoes back the SQL produced from a style sheet. The style sheet must be provided.
