These BNF documents have been generated by running the BnfExtractor utility against the main JavaCC 
file AdqlStoX.jjt, which is found in the java source directory of the adqlbase sub-project.
The extractor utility is within the adqlutils sub-project, where you will also find examples of 
header files used to generate the titles and headers of the BNF diagrams.
