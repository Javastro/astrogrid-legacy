       <p>
         The parsing component AdqlStoX is generated from a JavaCC module named AdqlStoX.jjt, named because
         the JavaCC framework generates from it AdqlStoX, as well as a fairly full syntax tree of modules all
         of whose names start with the prefix AST_. If you wish to see the main structure of ADQL as a language, 
         the AdqlStoX.jjt file is the one to study. It is heavily commented to pick out the main
         BNF structure of the language.
       </p>
       <p>
         Within the Maven build the generation is managed by a Maven v1.0 plugin. This is all automatic. 
         Please note, however, that the plugin required some amendment in order to function correctly. 
         If you have access to the AstroGrid Maven repository, the plugin should be automatically downloaded 
         when you need it. If you wish to build by hand, I recommend the Eclipse JavaCC plugin, which
         makes development a whole lot easier. Otherwise, you must read the JavaCC documentation to configure
         a command line execution of the generator.
