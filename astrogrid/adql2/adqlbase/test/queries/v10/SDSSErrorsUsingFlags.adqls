-- Another useful query is to see if the errors on moving (or
-- apparently moving) objects are correct. For example, it used to be that
-- some known QSOs were being flagged as moving objects. One way to look for
-- such objects is to compare the velocity to the error in velocity and see if
-- the "OBJECT1_MOVED" or "OBJECT2_BAD_MOVING_FIT" is set.
-- This query introduces bitwise logic for flags, and uses the 'as' syntax to
-- make the query more readable. Note that if a flag is not set, the value
-- will be zero. If you want to ensure multiple flags are not set, you can
-- either check that each individually is zero, or their sum is zero.
-- (From Gordon Richards)

-- NOTE: This query takes a long time to run without the "TOP 1000".
