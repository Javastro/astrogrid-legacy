-- Returns 1000 objects in a few sec.

-- Find all galaxies brighter than r magnitude 22, where the local
-- extinction is > 0.175. This is a simple query that uses a WHERE clause,
-- but now two conditions that must be met simultaneously. However, this
-- query returns a lot of galaxies (29 Million in DR2!), so it will take a
-- long time to get the results back. The sample therefore includes a
-- "TOP 1000" restriction to make it run quickly.
-- This query also introduces the Galaxy view, which contains the
-- photometric parameters (no redshifts or spectra) for unresolved objects.

SELECT TOP 1000 g.objID

    g.r < 22 	                -- r IS NOT deredenned
    and g.extinction_r > 0.175 	-- extinction more than 0.175
