-- Find all galaxies with blue surface brightness between 23 and 25
-- mag per square arcseconds, and -10 < supergalactic latitude (sgb) < 10, and
-- declination less than zero. Currently, we have to live with ra/dec until we
-- get galactic coordinates. To calculate surface brightness per sq. arcsec,
-- we use (g + rho), where g is the blue magnitude, and rho= 5*log(r). This
-- query now has three requirements, one involving simple math.
