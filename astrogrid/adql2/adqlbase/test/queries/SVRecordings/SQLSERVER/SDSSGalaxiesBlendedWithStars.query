-- Find galaxies that are blended with a star, and output the
-- deblended galaxy magnitudes.

-- This query introduces the use of multiple tables or views. You can assign
-- nicknames to tables as in the FROM clause below. Since you are using
-- multiple tables, you ,ust specify which table each quantity in the SELECT
-- clause comes from. Finally, the last line in the query is the join between
-- the two tables, which is achieved by requiring that a quantity present in
-- both tables be equal.

-- NOTE: This query takes a long time to run without the "TOP 1000".

SELECT G.ObjID, G.u, G.g, G.r, G.i, G.z 	-- get the ObjID and final mags
FROM Galaxy G, Star S 	-- use two Views, Galaxy and Star, as a
	-- convenient mechanism to compare objects
WHERE G.parentID > 0 	-- galaxy has a "parent", which tells us this
	-- object was deblended
    and G.parentID = S.parentID 	-- and the star has the same parent
