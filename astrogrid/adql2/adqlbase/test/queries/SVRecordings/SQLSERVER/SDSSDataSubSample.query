-- Extension: bit processing and hex literal.
-- Give me the colours of a random 1% sample of objects from all fields
-- which are 'survey quality' so that I could plot up colour-colour diagrams
-- and play around with more sophisticated cuts. From Karl Glazebrook. Uses
-- the HTM spatial index ID to apply the cut against. Replace the last '1' by
-- a different number if you want to sample a different percentage of objects.
