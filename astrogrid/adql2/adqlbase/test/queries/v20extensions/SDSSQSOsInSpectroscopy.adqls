-- Find quasars with 2.5 < redshift < 2.7. This will use the spectro tables,with a simple
-- multi-constraint WHERE clause. We introduce the use of a function, in this case
-- dbo.fSpecClass, to select objects by named types instead of using the bitwise flags.

SELECT specObjID, 	-- get the spectroscopic object id
    z, zConf, 	-- redshift, redshift confidence
    SpecClass 	-- and spectral classification
FROM SpecObj 	-- from the spectroscopic objects
WHERE
    -- use a function to translate SpecClass bits to names; want quasars 
    (SpecClass=dbo.fSpecClass('QSO') 
    or SpecClass=dbo.fSpecClass('HIZ_QSO')) 
    -- and the redshift is 2.5 to 2.7. Remember, z is redshift in SpecObj. 
    and z between 2.5 and 2.7 
    -- and we have a high confidence redshift estimate. 
    and zConf > 0.90
