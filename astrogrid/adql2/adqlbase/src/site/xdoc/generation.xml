       <p>
         The parsing component AdqlStoX is generated from a JavaCC module named AdqlStoX.jjt, named because
         the JavaCC framework generates from it AdqlStoX, as well as a fairly full syntax tree of modules all
         of whose names start with the prefix AST_. If you wish to see the main structure of ADQL as a language, 
         the AdqlStoX.jjt file is the one to study. It is heavily commented to pick out the main
         BNF structure of the language.
       </p>
       <p>
         Within the Maven build the code generation plugin is commented out. 
       </p>
       <p>
         If you wish to build by hand, I recommend the Eclipse JavaCC plugin, which
         makes development a whole lot easier. Otherwise, you must read the JavaCC documentation to configure
         a command line execution of the generator.
