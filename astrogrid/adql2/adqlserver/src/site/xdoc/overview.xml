       <p>
          There are two server versions of the parser: AdqlParserSV and AdqlParserSVNC, which implement the interface IAdqlParser. 
          Both implementations manage a pool of base parsers in a thread safe manner.
          The base parser is not thread safe and this is a simple way of circumventing the restriction.
          The AdqlParserSV version is based around callbacks for initialization and also to enable some manipulation of the XML prior to transforming 
          into SQL.
          The AdqlParserSVNC version has no callbacks. Different phases of the parser can be invoked to achieve the same effects as the version based around callbacks.
          Details are given in the respective javadocs.
