    	<subsection name="The Number of Parsers">
    		<p>
    		   The number of base parsers managed can be from 1 to 16, with default set to 2.
    		   The default is probably more than adequate.         
	       </p>
  		</subsection>
  		
  		<subsection name="Initialization Callback (AdqlParserSV only)">
    		<p>
    		   Each base parser should be initialized correctly. On first use of a parser instance this callback is 
    		   invoked upon it so that any settings can be set by the controlling environment.       
	       </p>

  		</subsection>
  		

  		<subsection name="Post-Parse Callback (AdqlParserSV only)">
    		<p>
    		   Once an ADQL query has been parsed into XML, this callback is invoked, passing a reference
    		   using XMLBeans. The controlling environment then has the option to alter the query directly using
    		   XMLBeans. After the callback returns, the query is translated given the set style sheet.
	       </p>
  		</subsection>
  		
  		<subsection name="AdqlParserSVNC">
    		<p>
    		   This version of the parser does not rely upon callbacks, but the invoker must manage the different phases of the process
    		   if manipulation of the intermediate XML is desired prior to any transformation by XSLT.
	       </p>
  		</subsection>
       
        <subsection name="Style Sheets">
    		<p>
    		   The query is translated into SQL using the set style sheet.
    		   There is a method for setting the style sheet, which applies to all the parsers within the pool. There
    		   are a sample of style sheets within the project which cover the major RDBMS manufacturers.
