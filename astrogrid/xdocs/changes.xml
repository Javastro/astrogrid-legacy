    		  <em>Branch Reg_KMB_Paging in astrogrid/registry:</em> Okay be good to make this a beta type version as part of the version name.  It
    		  has a lot of changes mainly targeting 1.0 VOResources and multiple contract ability.  I believe I have it though
    		  that everything can be copied/replaced into HEAD hence this branch can overwrite anything in HEAD even if there are
    		  merge conflicts.
    		  It needs to go with the
    		  contracts branch Contracts_KMB_XForms (which needs Guy's approval). - Kev will let me know when this is ready - CLQ
    		</action>
    		<action dev="kmb" type="add">
    		  <em>Branch Contracts_KMB_XForms n astrogrid/contracts:</em>  Only merge in src/java and src/schema stuff.  Originally
    		  this branch was for Xforms stuff, but that has not gone through, but still added a lot of new schemas 1.0.
    		  This needs Guy Rixon approval though. - Kev will let me know when this is ready - CLQ
                  I have modified Kevin's branch slightly in the light of discussions: CEAService v0.3 instead of the more-ambitious
                  v1.0; astrogrid-software-site added to branch and schemata index updated; maven-base added to branch and version
                  of contracts raised to 2006.3.02. Note that astrogrid-software-site needs to be built after contracts. The branch is now
                  ready to merge - GTR

    		  may be independent; the fix fof the current bug is in astrogrid/desktop/impl and the astrogrid/security change
    		  is to avoid future problems. However, the astrogrid/desktop/impl changes were tested with the astrogrid/security
