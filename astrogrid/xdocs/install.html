<H1>Downloading and installing Astrogrid</H1>
<H2>Introduction</H2>
<P>
Astrogrid consists of a number of components that can be
installed on a single machine or distributed across a network.  For
information on individual components, including how to install and 
configure them, please follow the links on the left under "Astrogrid Components".
Typically, an Astrogrid component consists of a Java WAR file that can be installed on Tomcat or any J2EE-compliant server and
offers a SOAP interface.
For those wishing to write java code to interact with Astrogrid components, delegate JAR files are also provided to remove the
need to call the web services directly.  For details please see the individual component documentation.

<P>
If you are familiar with the installation procedure, then the downloads links to the left
offer shortcuts to the latest binaries.

<H2>Quick Start</H2>
<P>
The quickest way to get started with Astrogrid is to install all the components on a single machine using AGINAB (Astrogrid
In A Box).  AGINAB is a maven script that downloads the appropriate Astrogrid components, installs them onto your local
Tomcat server and configures them.  Instructions for the use of AGINAB can be found <a href="integrationTests/index.html">here</a>.
