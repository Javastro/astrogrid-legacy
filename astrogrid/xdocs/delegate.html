<P>
	Most AstroGrid components are called via webservices and third parties are encouraged to develop applications
	that interoperate with them.  To facilitate this AstroGrid provides  <em>delegate/client</em> jars
	that enable Java applications to call AstroGrid components transparently, without having to deal with the
	web services directly.
