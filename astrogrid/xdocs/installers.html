<H1>Installing Astrogrid Server Applications</H1>
<P>
    If you are using Tomcat as your webapp container, then AstroGrid provides a number of graphical installer applications that 
    manage
    downloading, installing and configuring AstroGrid components.
    <BR/>
    These installer apps are executable jar files and require only that JDK1.4+ is installed on your machine.  Once downloaded, double-click 
    on the jar file (in Windows Explorer) or execute <BR/>
    <tt>java -jar installer-name.jar</tt><BR/>
    from the commandline.  As well as prompting you for any configuration settings, the installer will give you the opportunity to save your
    settings to allow easy reinstallation.
</P>
<P>
	Follow the links to the left to download the latest installer for each component.
</P>
<h2>Firewalls/proxies</h2>
<P>
    If you can only access the internet through a proxy then you run the installers with:<BR/>
    <tt>java -jar install-name.jar -p proxyhost:port [-u username:password]</tt>
</P>
<h2>Non-graphical environments</h2>
<P>
    The installers use a Swing-based GUI.  If you're installing on a headless machine, then run the installers with a <tt>-c</tt> switch
    to use text-only mode.
</P>
<h2>Out of Memory errors</h2>
<P>
    Try increasing the memory available to the JVM<BR/>
    <tt>java -Xmx128m -jar installer-name.jar</tt><BR/>
