These style sheets are a copy of the DSA style sheets used to transform ADQL/x into variant SQL.
Our aim was eventually to have them closetted with the ADQL parser rather than the DSA, 
so this is their first time they have appeared under a new parent. 
The parser does not use them so far. They are here for the record and for experimentation.
