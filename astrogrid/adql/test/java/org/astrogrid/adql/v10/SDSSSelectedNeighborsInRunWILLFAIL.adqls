-- This is a query from Robert Lupton that finds selected neighbors in a given run and
-- camera column. It contains a nested query containing a join, and a join with the
-- results of the nested query to select only those neighbors from the list that meet
-- certain criteria. The nested queries are required because the Neighbors table does
-- not contain all the parameters for the neighbor objects. This query also contains
-- examples of setting the output precision of columns with STR.

-- JL Note. This has been edited by hand and will need rebuilding completely
-- when all constructs are supported!
-- I also think there may be errors within the original. Study the aliases!
