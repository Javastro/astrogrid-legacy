       <p>
         The journey from ADQL to SQL can be represented in the following way:
       </p>
       <source>
         ADQL ---&gt; XML ---&gt; SQL
       </source>
       <p>
         The base parser achieves the first part of this process, represented by the first arrow in the diagram.
       </p>
       <p>
         The structure of the parser is roughly of the following form:
       </p>
       <source>
                        AdqlParser
                            |
               +------------+------------+
               |                         |
               |                         |
            AdqlStoX                  AST Tree
       </source> 
       <p>
       The top AdqlParser module is completely hand crafted. With some exceptions, the rest of the code is mostly
       generated using the JavaCC framework. AdqlStoX is in fact the main artifact and is the real parser 
       generated by JavaCC. The AST Tree is a tree of about 90 modules initially generated to represent the ADQL
       syntax tree, but thereafter hand crafted. AdqlParser is a thick and convenient wrapper to generated code.
