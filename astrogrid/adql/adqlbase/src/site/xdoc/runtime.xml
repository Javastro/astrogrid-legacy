    		The parser can be invoked for processing whole queries or fragments of queries.
    		First a new parser must be instantiated or an existing one re-initialized with the query or 
    		fragment of a query to be processed. There are then a number of convenience methods for executing a parse, 
    		depending upon what is required to be returned: DOM, XML text, or XMLBean. You can ask for the text
    		to be indented.
