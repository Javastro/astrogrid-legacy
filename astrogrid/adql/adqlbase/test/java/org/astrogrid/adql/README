Test files are organized by version number.
There should be directories for each version number of Adql, for example v074 and v10.
The files in these directories are organized along the following lines. 
All files have an extension of either .adqls or .adqlx
If a file has an extension of adqls, then it will contain the string form of a query.
If a file has an extension of adqlx, then it will contain the xml form of a query.

If an adqls file is paired with an adqlx file of the same name, then it is assumed the adqls query 
compiles into the twinned file format, and therefore the test can assert true on compilation.
If an adqls file is not paired, it is assumed the compilation will fail.

Test Methods. 
For each file of extension .adqls, there should be a corresponding testOf_ method.
Thus for file selectBinaries.adqls within directory v10 there is a method testOf_v10_selectBinaries() 
 
If the number of files and the number of methods do not tally, a warning message is issued.

Some things about the file names, simply for convenience...
(1) File names of those compilations that are designed to fail begin with the string "BAD".
(2) File names for fragment type processing have the word "Fragment" somewhere in the name.
(3) File names for selections involving multiple archives have the letters "MA" somewhere in the name.
(4) Some files have WILLFAIL embedded in the name. These are the focus of some experimentation and
    may or may not fail according to the success, extent or otherwise of the experiment.

Usually the above annotations are prefixed to the file name.
