-- Find quasars with 2.5 < redshift < 2.7. This will use the spectro tables,with a simple
-- multi-constraint WHERE clause. We introduce the use of a function, in this case
-- dbo.fSpecClass, to select objects by named types instead of using the bitwise flags.

SELECT so.specObjID,   -- get the spectroscopic object id
       so.z, so.zConf, -- redshift, redshift confidence
       so.SpecClass    -- and spectral classification
FROM SpecObj as so     -- from the spectroscopic objects
WHERE
    -- use a function to translate SpecClass bits to names; want quasars 
    (so.SpecClass=fSpecClass('QSO') 
    or so.SpecClass=fSpecClass('HIZ_QSO')) 
    -- and the redshift is 2.5 to 2.7. Remember, z is redshift in SpecObj. 
    and so.z between 2.5 and 2.7 
    -- and we have a high confidence redshift estimate. 
    and so.zConf > 0.90 ;
