      <title>Maven-1 plug-in for download pages: overview</title>
  </properties>
  <body>
    <section name="Overview">
      <p>This plug-in generates a Maven report that is a download page for the
      AstroGrid component in whose build the report is generated.</p>
      <p>The page
      contains a link to the artifact identified by the POM. The link always
      points to AstroGrid's Maven-1 repository at http://www.astrogrid.org/maven/,
      but the group identifier, artifact type, artifact identifier and version
      can all be varied to suit the project. The artifact type must be set
      explictly using a property of this plug-in, but the other variables are set 
      automatically from the POM. The report is put in the file <it>DOWNLOAD.xml</it>
      in the directory identified by <it>${maven.gen.docs}</it>.</p>

      <p>Using the plug-in avoids the need either to hard-code the version of
      the artifact in the source of the download page, or to add code to 
      <it>maven.xml</it> to write the version.</p>
