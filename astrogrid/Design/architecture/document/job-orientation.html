<h2>What are workflows for?<br>
</h2>
<p>A workflow is a way for an end-user to programme the system such
that low-level operations are combined into scientifically-meaningful
experiments. Workflows are roughly equivalent to shell scripts in a
traditional, desktop system, but the AstroGrid workflow facility has
these major differences from conventional scripting.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The workflows are set up graphically using the web portal. There is no scripting language available to end users.</li>
  <li>Where a desktop scripting-language has commands to local programmes, the workflow facility has calls to web services.</li>
  <li>Workflows execute asynchronously as batch jobs.<br>
  </li>
  <li>The workflow facility is specially designed to support parallel operations.</li>
  <li>Workflows are supposed to be easy to re-use for subsequent data-sets.</li>
  <li>The workflow executor automatically logs the results of
workflows, both the bulk-data outputs and the status of the jobs; no
user-programming is needed to store results.</li>
</ul>
<p>A particular running instance of a workflow is called a "job". A
single operation within that job is called a "job-step". Each job-step
represents one usage of a web service, with that usage spread over
several&nbsp; SOAP messages. <br>
</p>
<p>The AstroGrid architecture is based on workflows. The architecture
distinguishes data-processing work, including archive queries, from
other operations such as browsing directories of resources or
adminstering the system. Data processing is always done via workflows;
the other operations are always done interactively through the web
portal.</p>
<p>This defines AstroGrid as a "job-oriented" system. Every operation
that is not expected to be trivially short is a batch job and any
operation touching data is assumed to be non-trivial. An interactive
operation on data in AstroGrid is a batch job that completes in seconds
rather than hours or days. An end-user can treat any job as interactive
simply by polling its staus and waiting for it to finish. Conversely,
any job that was expected to be quick but turns out to lengthy can be
left to run to completion in batch; the user need do nothing extra to
make this happen.</p>
<p>AstroGrid is job-oriented in order to be scalable. The underlying
assumption for AstroGrid is that the virtual observatory is for
handling large processing jobs; jobs small enough to run interactively
are a special case. Therefore, the whole system has job orientation,
not just selected parts for which large-data-volume use cases are known.</p>
<h2>How are workflows defined and executed?</h2>
Workflows are:<br>
<ul>
  <li>defined by end-users via the web portal;</li>
  <li>recorded permanently in MySpace files;</li>
  <li>submitted for execution by the users via the web-portal;</li>
  <li>executed by the Job Execution Service (JES), which is an AstroGrid sub-system built as a web service;</li>
  <li>clients of the web-services that actually operate on the data;<br>
  </li>
  <li>monitored by the users via the web portal.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>It is JES that calls the web-services designated in a workflow.</p>
<p>The processes involved are explained more fully in the <a href="generated/use-cases/workflow-use-cases.html">workflow use cases</a>.</p>
<h2>How does job orientation affect the architecture?</h2>
<p>Job orientation <span style="font-style: italic;">defines</span>
AstroGrid's architecture. No useful work can be done on AstroGrid (at
least via the supported use cases) without building a workflow and
submitting a job. The most-important parts of the architecture are the
interfaces between the web portal and JES and between JES and the
data-handling services. These interface are AstroGrid's <a href="cea.html">Common Execution Architecture</a> (CEA).</p>
<p>Job orientation demands that the system record the specification of
each job. CEA is a mechanism for recording those specifications and for
passing them to web services. This descriptive power means that all CEA
services have the same interface (same WSDL contract) and execution of
any workflow, for any astronomical purpose, can be described by the
same use case. The differences between jobs show up only inside the
portal and inside the CEA services.<br>
