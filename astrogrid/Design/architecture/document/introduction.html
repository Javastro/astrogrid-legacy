<h1>Introduction</h1>
<h2>About AstroGrid</h2>
<p>AstroGrid is the UK's virtual-observatory project. AstroGrid is
funded (by the Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council) to
produce software within which data archives and data-processing
software can be used. AstroGrid is not itself a producer of
data-processing software for the UK (other projects, notably Starlink,
do that), nor is it an operating organization for British parts of the
virtual observatory (data-centres at British universities do that).
AstroGrid's product is a software framework that can be deployed by
other organizations. This document describes that product.</p>
<p>More information about AstroGrid as an organization is available on <a href="http://www.astrogrid.org/">AstroGrid's main web-site</a>.</p>
<h2>About the virtual observatory</h2>
<p>The virtual-observatory (VO) movement started with the aim of
unifying all the existing on-line archives. During the long gestation
of the VO, the grid paradigm of distributed processing arose in
computer science. The early VO workers recognized that distributed
processing would become as important as access to distributed data in
the current era of large surveys; data volumes are rising beyond the
point where all necessary data can be processed on a researcher's
dekstop. The VO is thus evolving from being a unified set of web-sites
for interactive querying of archives to being a data grid (i.e. a
wide-area, distributed filing system) for local applications and
finally into a computational grid for distributed processing. Regional
VO projects focus on different stages of this evolution; AstroGrid is
strongly focussed on the later stages of the evolution and has
exceptional support for large-scale computation.</p>
<p>The VO movement is regulated (at least in technical matters) by the
International Virtual Observatory Alliance. More information about the
VO movement can be found on <a href="http://www.ivoa.net/">the IVOA web-site</a>.</p>
<h2>About this document</h2>
<p>This "document" is a guide to the architecture of AstroGrid's software framework (it is <span style="font-style: italic;">not</span>
the user manual!) and is intended to inform technical readers who must
work with that software. As such, it combines short, introductory
essays with a large volume of detail generated from a UML model; that
model in turn is largely generated from the code base. Readers with
different background and with different goals will need to consider
different parts of the mass of information, so there is no unique path
through the material.&nbsp; Some recommended paths are shown here.</p>
<h3>For service providers</h3>
<p>If you intend to provide a service in the VO by deploying AstroGrid
components, then you should read the section on service organization;
this has links to the installations guides for the components.&nbsp;
Next read the essays on <a href="job-orientation.html">workflow and job orientation</a>, <a href="cea.html">Common Execution Architecture</a>,
the resource registry and MySpace; these affect all service providers.
To support deployment of data-processing services, read the description
of how applications are coupled to the CEA. If you plan to deploy your
own resource registry, then you should further study the corresponding <a href="generated/use-cases/deploy-registry.html">use-case</a> which supports the installation guide for the registry.<br>
</p>
<h3>For end-users</h3>
<p>This is not the user manual; look on <a href="http://www.astrogrid.org/">AstroGrid's main site</a> for pointers to that. To understand technically what AstroGrid does for you as a researcher you might read the <a href="job-orientation.html">essay</a> and <a href="generated/use-cases/workflow-use-cases.html">use cases</a>
about workflows, since all data processing in AstroGrid is done via
workflows. You may also find it useful to read the essays on the
registry and on MySpace.</p>
<h3>For software developers inside AstroGrid<br>
</h3>
<p>If you already know the architecture, you can ignore the introductory essays and use the reference material. The section on the <a href="maven-projects.html">Maven projects</a>
lists the artefacts produced by each Maven project and the compile-time
dependencies. It also includes lists of the packages contained in each
project. The section on the <a href="generated/org/Package.html">code-base</a>
presents the code as a unified tree which may sometimes be more useful
than the fragmented view in the pages produced by Maven during the
scheduled builds. The section on <a href="generated/webapps/Package.html">web applications</a>
lists the main interfaces for each sub-system, including the set
of&nbsp; web services; this information is not readily available from
the documentation produced by Maven. There is also a section of the
model containing <a href="generated/patterns/Package.html">design patterns</a>.<br>
</p>
<h3>For those with a non-HTML form of the document<br>
</h3>
This material isn't properly readable except as hypertext; there's too
much detail to handle that way. Therefore, the "document" is issued as
a web site. If you have a serialized copy (e.g. paper or PDF), then I
suggest that you read only the introductory essays and refer to the
on-line version for the UML details.</body></html>
