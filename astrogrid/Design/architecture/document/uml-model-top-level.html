<h1>Top level of UML model</h1>

<p>The diagrams and accompmanying notes in this document are part of a
large UML model generated with a CASE tool. The model is organized as
trees of packages ("packages" in UML are general containers and need
not map to Java packages). Most of the main sections of the document
link to packages, or to parts of packages, lower down in the tree. This
page links to the top-most packages in the tree, from which all parts
of the model may be reached.</p>
