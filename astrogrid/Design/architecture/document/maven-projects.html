<h1>Organization of Java source code</h1>
<p>AstroGrid's products are built using Maven. There are many Maven "projects" which are described in the <a href="generated/Maven.html">UML model</a> and in the <a href="http://www.astrogrid.org/maven/docs/SNAPSHOT/">reports made by Maven itself</a>
(during AstroGrid's scheduled builds of the system). many Maven
projects have a groups sub-projects; e.g. separate sub-projects to
build client-side and server-side components.</p>
<p>The Java packages are dispersed among the Maven projects. Many
packages are actually split between several projects. The map of code
in the <a href="generated/Maven.html">UML description of the projects</a> may help to find where a given class has been stored.  </p>
