<h1>MySpace and virtual storage</h1>
<p>MySpace is a virtual file-system. It gives uses the illusion of a
directory-tree of files in one system; in reality, the files may be
distributed across many servers. The distributed system makes the
storage available throughout AstroGrid; the virtual directory tree
makes this distribution manageable for the users.<br>
</p>
<p> Storage services in MySpace are of two kinds: MySpace managers
support the directory tree and Filestores provide the data storage.
Physical files are found on Filestores (and any given physical file is
entirely on one Filestore); virtual files are found on MySpace
managers. The storage on Filestores is flat; they act as one per
service and that directory may hold files for many different users. The
virtual storage on MySpace managers is tree-like, and each user has his
or own branch of the tree. <br>
</p>
<p>MySpace is arranged to provide each user with a homespace: a virtual
home directory. Additional storage for bulk data may, in principle, be
leased for a fixed period and added to a user's MySpace: this is the
equivalent of scratch discs in a physical file system. In the current
system, all storage is included in the homespace and no leasing occurs.</p>
<p>Client software gets at the data via the MySpace manager services.
These services allow the contents of files to be read or written with
the data travelling as parts of SOAP messages. In this mode, an entire
file is read or written in each message; no streaming is possible. This
is the mode of file access used in the <a href="generated/use-cases/workflow-use-cases.html">workflow use-cases</a>. The manager acts as a facade to the Filestore and delagates data-access operations.</p>
<p>It is also possible to ask the MySpace manager to provide a URL by
which the file may be streamed to the client. In this case, the URL is
provided by a SOAP operation on the manager (which it delegates to the
filestore). but the client talks directly to the Filestore
web-application when downloading the data. The <a href="generated/use-cases/MySpace-use-cases.html">MySpace use cases</a> show this in more detail. There is no matching upload operation that links the client directly to the Filestore.</p>
<p>Currently, MySpace is using IVORN syntax for virtual file names, and
using it in a subtle way. An IVORN is a URI with the scheme <span style="font-style: italic;">ivo</span>
and it consists in an authority ID and a resource key. Together, the
authoeiry ID and resource key identify an entry in an IVOA resource
registry. The resource key may have several levels separated by forward
slashes; it tends to look like a file path and there is an implication
of hierarchy. For example:</p>
<pre>ivo://org.astrogrid.cam/INT-WFS/SIAP<br></pre>
<p>is an IVORN for the resource INT-WFS/SIAP with authority
org.astrogrid.cam (which might be the SIAP service in the INT-WFS
service-cluster under the Cambridge authority).<br>
</p>
<p>In a MySpace name, the front part is the IVORN for the manager
maintaining the directory tree in which the virtual file lives.
Following this is a file path. E.g.</p>
<pre>ivo://org.astrogrid.cam/MySpace/gtr/2004/qqq.dat<br></pre>
<p>is virtual file <span style="font-style: italic;">/gtr/2004/qqq.dat</span>
on the manager service ivo://org.astrogrid.cam/MySpace. To distinguish
the file path from the IVORN for the service takes special logic that
is built into the resolver classes of the AstroGrid code.</p>
<p>The virtual files in MySpace form VOSpace which consists entirely of
entries on services registered in the IVO registry; hence the trick
with the IVORNs can work. Data sources and sinks in AstroGrid are not
all within VOSpace; unregistered file-servers such as web-sites and
local disc are also accessible. VOSpace locations can be described by
IVORNs; non-VOSpace locations are not virtual and must be described
with URLs. AstroGrid's distributed file system deals with "store space"
which is the union of VOSpace and the space covered by URLs. A location
in store space is described by an AstroGrid Store Locator (AGSL). An
AGSL includes either a URL or an IVORN for a VOSpace location which has
been annotated with the endpoint address of the Manager service
carrying that virtual file. E.g.</p>
<pre>astrogrid:store:http://archive.ast.cam.ac.uk/INT-WFS/image/r123456.fits<br></pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre>astrogrid:store:myspace:[ivo://org.astrogrid.cam/MySpace]http://ag01.ast.cam.ac.uk#/gtr/2004/qqq.dat<br></pre>
<p>Software that processes AGSL is required to deal with both forms. In
each case, there is enough information to obtain the data of the file
without further resolution of the name by an external service. <br>
</p>
<p>AGSLs are concrete but short-lived. They should not be archived
because they can be invalidated by changes in the underlying storage.
IVORNs, be comparison, are abstract but are safer to archive.</p>
<p>Martin Hill has written <a href="http://www.astrogrid.org/maven/docs/SNAPSHOT/mySpace/multiproject/astrogrid-store-client/apidocs/index.html">more about store space and AGSLs</a>.</p>
<p>AGSLs have a complicated and subtle syntax. They are not something
that users should be expected to predict. A good UI for AstroGrid
should allow users to work only with the file-path part of their file
names and should add the AGSL prefix when appropriate. Unfortunately,
in the current system, users <span style="font-style: italic;">do</span> have to type in AGSLs. This is probably the single greatest useability problem in the current software.<br>
