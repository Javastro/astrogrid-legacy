<h1>Organization of services</h1>







<p>AstroGrid's run-time components are grouped into sub-systems.
Every sub-system provides on-line services; most provide SOAP services;
some are also clients of of other sub-systems. Currently, there are no
sub-systems that are desktop clients; the sub-system providing the UI
is a web portal.</p>







<p>Sub-systems may be independently deployed on a host computer, and
they are packaged to ease deployment. All the sub-systems are packaged
as J2EE web-applications. They all require to be deployed into a J2EE
servlet-engine (but the EJB side of J2EE is not required). In practice,
the servlet engine must be Jakarta-Tomcat 5. Older versions of Tomcat
may work but are not supported and other makes of engine have not even
been tried.</p>







<p>This is the current list of sub-systems.</p>

<p>The majority of the sub-systems provide web services using the
Simple Image Access Protocol (SOAP) and are based on Apache Axis. They
follow a common pattern; it may help to read the <a href="generated/webapps.Axis/Package.html">Axis pattern</a> before
reading the models of specific packages.</p>

<p class="caption">Relationship of sub-systems to frameworks.</p>






<p>There is no rigorous leveling of the services into tiers. Any
sub-system may, in principle, call any other. In practice there are
well-established dependencies between sub-systems. These dependencies
represent messages (almost always SOAP messages) between clients and
services.

<p class="caption">Run-time dependencies between deployed web applications.</p>








<p>Deployment is flexible; the web applications may be dispersed among
many computers or they may be grouped. The extreme deployment has every
web application on a separate node.</p>

<p>A more-typical deployment groups sub-systems according to function and the intentions of the operators.</p>

<p>The portal site runs sub-systems to support a user community:</p>





<ul>





  <li>astrogrid-portal to provide the UI;</li>
  <li>astrogrid-community to register users and to allow them privileged access to other services.</li>
  <li>astrogrid-myspace to manage the users' grid-attached storage;</li>
  <li>astrogrid-filestore to provide virtual home-discs for the users;</li>
  <li>astrogrid-jes to manage jobs submitted by users.</li>
</ul>





<p>The registry site runs astrogrid-registry plus astrogrid-exist to provide the storage for registry metadata.</p>





<p>The three archive sites run different mixes of data-selection,
data-processing and data-storage sub-systems. Archive 3 runs the
minimum: just PAL, to give stateless access to an archive. Archive 2
runs PAL with local caching of results. Archive 1 runs both
data-selection and data-processing services and uses local storage to
optimize the passing of data between the two. The archive with no local
storage can send results to other deployments of astrogrid-filestore.</p>
<p>A plausible AstroGrid would have one registry (registries are
mirrors of each other, so duplicates are only needed to reduce
down-time); a handful of portals (at least one is needed; HEIs and
data-centres may want to operate customized versions); many archives.<br>
