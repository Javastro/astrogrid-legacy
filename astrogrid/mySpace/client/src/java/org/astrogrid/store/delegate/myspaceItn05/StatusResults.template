/**
 * <p>
 * The <code>StatusResults</code> class stores details of the error,
 * warning or information messages generated by a MySpace Service.
 * Each <code>StatusResults</code> object stores the details for a single
 * message.  These objects are the mechanism by which the inner delegate 
 * delivers status messages from the Manager and the other services
 * which the Manager has invoked.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The template contains the member variables for the class and get and
 * set methods for every member variable.  No other methods should be
 * included as these will be removed by the Axis utilities which
 * construct the final Java class from the template.  These utilities
 * will also add methods to serialise the class as a SOAP object.
 * </p>
