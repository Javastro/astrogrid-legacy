Introduction
------------

One of the steps in installing a new MySpace System is to create a
MySpace registry for that system.  This note describes how to create a
new mySpace registry.  An example registry is included in the
installation kit, though for a real MySpace system, which is to be used
for production work, you will probably want to create a customised
MySpace registry from scratch.

A MySpace registry comprises two tables in a database.  Currently the
DBMS used to create and manipulate this database and its tables is
HSQLDB (see http://hsqldb.sourceforge.net/), which is available in the
public domain.  The MySpace release includes a copy of HSQLDB and you do
not need to obtain any additional software (though you might want to
consult the home page given above for interest).  The two tables in a
MySpace registry are:

  REG     a list of all the files known to the MySpace system,

  SERVERS a list of all the servers in the MySpace system.

The REG table is initially empty and will be gradually populated once
the MySpace system is deployed and the MySpace manager is invoked to
create users and import files for these users.  However, the SERVERS
table must be populated before the MySpace system is deployed.  Thus,
creating a MySpace registry consists of: creating a database, creating
the two tables in this database and populating the SERVERS table.  It
would, in principle, be possible to perform these operations by entering
the appropriate SQL commands into one of the HSQLDB utility programs,
but this would be tiresome and error-prone.  Instead, a utility,
CreateMySpaceRegistry, is provided to perform the necessary operations.
This utility, in turn, reads the details of the servers to be included
in the MySpace system from a text file.  You will prepare a version of
this file, containing details of your servers, before running
CreateMySpaceRegistry.  An example file is included in the release and
the format of the file is described below.

You might occasionally need to amend the SERVERS table for an
operational MySpace registry, perhaps because a new server is being
added or perhaps to change some of the details of an existing server.
Eventually a set of screens will be provided for this operation.
However, in Iteration 4 you need to enter the appropriate SQL directly
using one of the HSQLDB utilities.  Some examples are provided below.

The structure of this document is as follows.  The subsequent sections
describe where to find the example files, discuss some matters about the
registry name and describe the format of the CreateMySpaceRegistry input 
file.  The penultimate section presents the complete procedure to create
a new registry.  The final section gives examples of querying and
updating the registry tables using a standard HSQLDB utility.


Example Files
-------------

The installation kit includes the HSQLDB database files for an example
MySpace registry and the corresponding example input file for the
CreateMySpaceRegistry program.  These files reside in directory:

 .../astrogrid/mySpace/demoData

The example files are:

  HSQLDB database files: {           example.db.properties
                         {           example.db.script

  CreateMySpaceRegistry input file:  example.servers

You will probably find it convenient to have a copy of example.servers to
hand as you read this note.


The Registry Name and Registry File Names
-----------------------------------------

The very first thing that you need to do when creating a registry is to
decide on its name.  This name will be used as a component of several
Unix file names, so it is sensible to restrict it to contain only
alphanumeric characters and the underscore (`_').  Punctuation
characters, special characters and spaces are all best avoided.  You
will probably use the same name for the registry as for the MySpace
system.

The names of the HSQLDB database files are generated from the registry
name in a fairly obvious fashion (see the examples in the preceding
section).  The name of the CreateMySpaceRegistry input file is the
registry name followed by `.servers'.



The CreateMySpaceRegistry Input File
------------------------------------

See file: example.servers

The CreateMySpaceRegistry input file lists the servers to be included in
the MySpace system and specifies their details.  The format of this file
is quite flexible.  Comment and blank lines can be freely included as 
required, and their use to improve readability is encouraged.  Comments
begin with a `#' character and continue for the rest of the line.

The details of each server must occupy a single line.  Each server is
specified by five items, which must be separated by one or more spaces.
The items required are as follows and must occur in the following order:

* The string `server', which must be in lower case,

* the name of the server (as it will appear in listings of containers
  and files),

* the expiry period for files on the server, in days,

* a URL corresponding to the directory on the server which holds
  the data files,

* the actual file name of the directory on the server containing
  the data files.

A MySpace system can contain an arbitrary number of servers and an entry
must be supplied for every server in the system.  At least one server
entry must be present.  Obviously, the names of the servers must be
distinct.

IMPORTANT RESTRICTION: currently one of the servers must be called `serv1'.


The Procedure to Create a New Registry
--------------------------------------

The procedure to create a new MySpace registry is as follows.

1. Choose a name for the registry; it will probably be the name of your
   MySpace system.

2. Create an appropriate input file for CreateMySpaceRegistry, listing
   the servers to be included in the MySpace system.  The format is
   described in the preceding section and the example file included in
   the Iteration 4 kit can be used as a template.

3. Create the registry by running the CreateMySpaceRegistry utility,
   which resides in directory:

    .../astrogrid/mySpace/src/java/org/astrogrid/mySpace/mySpaceDemo

   Set an appropriate CLASSPATH (*MAGIC DETAILS OMITTED*) and then:

     java org/astrogrid/mySpace/CreateMySpaceRegistry registry-name

   for example, with the example files:

     java org/astrogrid/mySpace/mySpaceDemo/CreateMySpaceRegistry example

   Note that the CreateRegistry utility requires the name of the
   registry, not the name of the input file.

4. You can check that the registry was created successfully by using
   the HSQLDB utility DatabaseManager (see the following section).  The
   REG table will initially be empty, but the contents of the SERVERS
   table can be displayed by entering the SQL:

     SELECT * FROM SERVERS


Direct Access to the Registry Tables
------------------------------------

This section describes how to use the HSQLDB utility DatabaseManager to
query or update tables in a MySpace registry.  DatabaseManager is run
from the Unix shell.  The procedure is as follows.

1. Set an appropriate CLASSPATH (*MAGIC DETAILS OMITTED*).

2. Run DatabaseManager:

     java org.hsqldb.util.DatabaseManager -url jdbc:hsqldb:registry-name.db

   for example, with the example database:

     java org.hsqldb.util.DatabaseManager -url jdbc:hsqldb:example.db

   The DatabaseManager window will then appear.  Enter the required SQL
   statement and click on the `Execute' panel.

You might use DatabaseManager to query either of the two tables or to
update table SERVERS.  However, I strongly recommend that you do not
use it to update table REG, as you are likely to leave the registry
inconsistent with the files on the servers.  Examples of the SQL
required for various common operations are listed below.

Query table REG

  SELECT * FROM REG

Query table SERVERS

  SELECT * FROM SERVERS

Add a new server to table SERVERS

  INSERT INTO SERVERS (name, expiryPeriod, URI, directory)
    VALUES ('serv3', 45, 'http://www.blue.nowhere.org/s3/',
   '/base/direct/s3/')

Delete a server from table SERVERS

  DELETE FROM SERVERS WHERE (name='serv3')

  Obviously a server should only be deleted from the SERVERS table after
  the MySpace manager has been used to remove all the files from the server.

Update the entry for a server in table SERVERS

  UPDATE SERVERS SET expiryPeriod=37 WHERE (name='serv3')

  Here the expiry period for server serv3 is being set to 37 days.  The
  syntax to update the other columns is similar (but don't forget to
  enclose string values in single quotes).
