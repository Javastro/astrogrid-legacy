                       Installing a MySpace Service
                       ============================
                               --- DRAFT ---

                        A C Davenhall and J D Taylor
                         Version 3, 23 January 2004


Purpose and Status of this Document
-----------------------------------

This document describes how to install a simple AstroGrid MySpace
service.  It gives enough information to install a basic service, but
all the configuration options are not covered.  It refers to the version
of MySpace available at the end of AstroGrid Iteration 4 in late
December 2003 or very early January 2004.  At this juncture the
installation procedures for MySpace are in a state of flux and likely to
change on a time-scale of weeks.  Thus, this version of the document is
unlikely to remain current for very long.


Prerequisites
-------------

In order to install MySpace you require access to a computer (in practice
a PC) running the following:

* RedHat Linux version 7.2 is recommended.  However, MySpace has been
  installed successfully on a machine running RedHat Linux version 7.1.

* Tomcat version 1.2.24 or better.  Tomcat is available from the Apache
  Software Foundation.  See http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/.

* Though Tomcat can, in principle, be used in isolation, it is usually
  installed with a conventional HTTP server, one of which is also
  available from Apache (see http://www.apache.org/ and
  http://httpd.apache.org/).

* A copy of the MySpace war file, which can be obtained from
  http://www.astrogrid.org/maven/build/mySpace/index.html

You need to be able to log in to Tomcat with the role of `manager'.  A
list of Tomcat users can be found in file:

  $CATALINA_HOME/conf/tomcat_users.xml

where $CATALINA_HOME is the root directory of your Tomcat installation.
You also need access to a Unix account able to read, write and execute
files in the directories where Tomcat is installed.


Installation Procedure
----------------------

To install an AstroGrid MySpace service proceed as follows.

1. If you have not already done so then download a copy of the MySpace war
   file and save it as a file on a local disk.

   If you wish to build the war file from the MySpace source code,
   rather than using a downloaded copy, the final section of this note
   gives the details.

   The name of the war file is astrogrid-mySpace.war and by default the
   Web service adopts the name of the war file.  Thus, for the remainder
   of these notes it will be assumed that the MySpace Web service will
   be called `astrogrid-mySpace'.  If you rename the war file then the
   name of the Web service will be correspondingly different.

2. Using a Web browser, log in to your Tomcat's Application Manager,
   which is often found at:

     http://localhost:8080/Manager

   Note that you will need access to (ie. a password for) a Tomcat
   account with the role of Manager.

   Scroll down to the `Upload a WAR file to install' section towards the
   bottom of the page.  Click on the `Browse...' button and select the
   MySpace war file which you have downloaded.  Then click on the
   `Install' button.

   If all goes well, a new entry, probably called astrogrid-mySpace,
   should appear in the list of applications and it should be shown as
   running.

   Tomcat creates Web services in subdirectory webapps of its home
   directory, with a separate subdirectory for each service.  There
   should now be a subdirectory for the MySpace service, called
   astrogrid-mySpace.  That is, the following directory should have been
   created:

     $CATALINA_HOME/webapps/astrogrid-mySpace

   where $CATALINA_HOME is the root directory of your Tomcat installation.

3. The present simple installation procedure creates a MySpace service
   with a single MySpace server for holding files.  You need to choose a
   directory where these files will be located.  The MySpace Web service
   will need to be able to read and write files in this directory and
   the files also need to be accessible via URLs.

   For an operational service it is unwise to choose a directory which
   is a subdirectory of the MySpace Web service directory because all
   the files will be deleted if the Web service is removed (which you
   will probably want to do periodically).

   (On grendel12 I chose a sibling directory to the one for the Web
   service:

     $CATALINA_HOME/webapps/myspacerepository

   and made its contents accessible via URLs by putting a fake (ie.
   non-working) MySpace service in this directory.  However, this was a
   kludge adopted because I didn't understand the relationship between
   directories and URLs on grendel12.)

4. You also need to choose the directory where the HSQLDB DBMS which
   MySpace uses to record the files in the MySpace system is to be
   located.  Again it is sensible to locate this file outside the Web
   service directory, so that it is not deleted when the service is
   removed.  It is probably sensible (for security) to choose a
   directory not accessible as a URL, though the MySpace Web service
   does need to be able to read and write to it.

5. You have now chosen directories where:

  - the server files are to be held,

  - the HSQLDB DBMS is to be located.

   Make the directory you have chosen for the HSQLDB DBMS your current
   directory and type:

   cp $CATALINA_HOME/webapps/astrogrid-mySpace/astrogrid-mySpace.servers .

   Note that the servers file, here astrogrid-mySpace.servers, must
   have the same name as your Web service, but with file-type `servers'.

6. Edit the copy of astrogrid-mySpace.servers.  Most of this file is
   comments and you need to edit only the final line:

    server serv1  23  http://www.blue.nowhere.org/s1/  /base/direct/s1/

   Replace:

     http://www.blue.nowhere.org/s1/ with the URL for your server directory

   and:

     /base/direct/s1/ with the server directory's full path and name.

   Note that the server name must be left at `serv1' and that the `23'
   is the expiry period in days.  You can substitute any value you
   prefer, but expiry periods are not fully implemented in Iteration 4.

7. Now make:

     $CATALINA_HOME/webapps/astrogrid-mySpace/
 
   your current directory and edit file astrogrid1.sh.   Change the
   database name in the final line to the name of your Web service
   preceded by the directory to hold the database files.  For example,
   if the database where being put in directory 
   /home/astrogrid/myspacedata you would put:

     /home/astrogrid/myspacedata/astrogrid-mySpace

   Then run script astrogrid1.sh.  The following HSQLDB files should be
   created in the chosen directory:

     astrogrid-mySpace.db.properties
     astrogrid-mySpace.db.script

   These are simply text files and you can examine them if you wish.

   For further details of setting up the MySpace DBMS see the companion
   document `Creating a New Myspace Registry' in file:

     astrogrid/mySpace/xdocs/createregistry_v02.lis

8. Move the file:

    $CATALINA_HOME/webapps/astrogrid-mySpace/ASTROGRID_myspacemanagerconfig.xml

   to the directory:

     $CATALINA_HOME/webapps/astrogrid-mySpace/WEB-INF/classes
     
   (The file is not automatically placed in this directory so that
   existing configurations are not lost if you are updating an installation.)
   Then edit the copy:

     $CATALINA_HOME/webapps/astrogrid-mySpace/WEB-INF/classes/
                                           ASTROGRID_myspacemanagerconfig.xml

   Edit the properties MYSPACEMANAGERURL and MYSPACEMANAGERURLs and set
   both their values to:

     http://<your host>:8080/astrogrid-mySpace/services/MySpaceManager

   Note that MYSPACEMANAGERURLs should have a comma (`,') after the
   entry, eg:

     http://<your host>:8080/astrogrid-mySpace/services/MySpaceManager,

   This requirement is, ahem, a feature, which will be addressed shortly.

   You can check the address by browsing to it; you should get a page
   saying `this is a web service'.

   Now edit the property REGISTRYCONF and set it to the full name of
   the HSQLDB database, including the full directory path.  For example,
   if the database where being put in directory 
   /home/astrogrid/myspacedata you would set it to:

     /home/astrogrid/myspacedata/astrogrid-mySpace

   It is sensible to make a copy of ASTROGRID_myspacemanagerconfig.xml
   outside the MySpace server directories, so that you retain a copy
   when you remove the Web service.

9. You can optionally customise the introductory Web page for your
   MySpace service.  Edit file:

     $CATALINA_HOME/webapps/astrogrid-mySpace/index.html

   A title and introductory paragraph can be inserted between the lines:

     <!-- Start customisation
     <!-- End customisation -->

   You can, of course, edit other parts of the file if you wish, but
   this is not recommended.  Again it is sensible to make a copy of the
   file outside the MySpace server directories, so that you retain a copy
   when you remove the Web service.

10.Go back to the Tomcat Manager Web page and reload the MySpace Web
   service (note: do not remove the Web service since this will wipe out
   your configuration).

11.The MySpace Web service should now be deployed.

   You can access it either by following the link from the Tomcat
   Manager page, or by accessing URL:

     http://<your host>:8080/astrogrid-mySpace/

   There are various test and example pages that you can try out to
   check that all is well.


Building the MySpace War File from Source
-----------------------------------------

To build the MySpace war file from source proceed as follows.

1. If you do not have a copy of Maven (http://maven.apache.org/)
   then obtain and install a copy and set up for using it.

2. Obtain a copy of the source.  It can be extracted anonymously from
   the AstroGrid CVS repository:

     cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@cvs.astrogrid.org:/devel \
                                       checkout -P astrogrid/mySpace
     cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@cvs.astrogrid.org:/devel \
                                       checkout -P astrogrid/maven-site

3. Make:

     astrogrid/mySpace

   your current directory and type:

     maven clean
     maven site
     maven war

   All three commands produce output, the last two voluminously so.
   If all has gone well then the last two commands include towards the
   end of their spiel the welcome salutation:

     BUILD SUCCESSFUL

4. The war file should have been created as file:

     astrogrid/mySpace/target/astrogrid-mySpace.war
