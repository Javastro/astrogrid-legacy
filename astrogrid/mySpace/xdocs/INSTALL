INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS
=========================
Tomcat v.1.2.24 or better, with a login with role Manager (see $CATALINA_HOME/conf/tomcat_users.xml)


INSTALL
=======
First obtain your war file (see download section).
Log in to your Tomcat's Manager Application (often found at http://localhost:8080/Manager)
Using the "Upload war to install" section, navigate to your downloaded war and click install.
If all goes well, a new entry should appear in the list of applications, and it should be listed as running.

Setting up the HSQLDB database 
==============================
Log in to the host machine and cd to $CATALINA_HOME/webapps/<your webapp>
Edit the file astrogrid1.servers - see the createregistry_v02.lis page for details
Execute the script astrogrid1.sh
You should see the message "MySpace registry astrogrid1 created successfully."
Move the generated *.db.* files to $CATALINA_HOME

Configuration
=============
Open $CATALINA_HOME/webapps/<your webapp>/WEB-INF/classes/ASTROGRID_myspacemanagerconfig.xml
Edit the properties MYSPACEMANAGERURL and MYSPACEMANAGERURLs and set their values to
http://<your host>:8080/<your webapp>/services/MySpaceManager
(you can check this address by browsing to it - you should get a page saying "this is a web service")
Go back to the Tomcat Manager page and reload the webservice (NB don't remove the webservice since this will wipe out your config)

Test
====
Browse to 
http://<your host>:8080/<your webapp>
You should find a welcome page linking to documentation and tests.
