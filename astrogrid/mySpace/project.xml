    <description> MySpace provides astronomers with data storage that is not
        necessarily at their home institution and which they can use to store
        things (e.g. result sets from queries, workflows, private datasets,
        etc) related to their work within the AstroGrid system. Users will be
        able to interact with their holdings in MySpace as easily as if they
        were directly on a local machine - i.e. transparent access/listings,
        ease of moving files between MySpace and a local machine, with no need
        for special logins (beyond generic log into AstroGrid).</description>
