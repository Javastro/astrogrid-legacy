The store package defines the representations and delegates used to describe and
access data on store points.

<h3>Store-Space</h3>

Store-Space is the set of store points that we assume Astrogrid components must be
able to reach to read from and write to.  This includes local disk space, MySpace,
FTP servers (for read access at least), Grid FTP servers and Http servers (for read
access at least).
<p>
This package defines a consistent way of accessing all these store points, so that
the user (whether human or automatic) can specify where inputs are to be read from
and outputs are to be sent in a consistent way, and the software that is expected
to use these references can also just call methods on classes in this package
and expect everything to Just Work.

<h3>VO-Space</h3>

VO-Space is a subset of Store-Space, describing all the store points that
are 'Registered' with VO Registries and/or Astrogrid Community Registries.  Store points
such as local files, intranet FTP servers, etc will probably not be part of VO-Space.

<h3>Naming things in VO-Space</h3>

The IVO have created a resource 'identifier' with the scheme <code>ivo:</code> .  Strictly
speaking this is a resource 'name' as they are intended as Registry lookup keys and cannot
be used as locators. In this package they are referred to as IVORNs (International Virtual Observatory Resource Names)
and are represented by the class <code>Ivorn</code> in this package but in the common CVS directory.

<h3>Locating things in Store-Space</h3>

A location in Store-Space might refer to a file on an FTP server, or a file on a local
disk, or a file in myspace. To represent this we have an AstroGrid Storepoint Locator (AGSL) that
returns a location to this file, which is represented in turn by the <code>Agsl</code> class.

<h3>Resolving Names to Locations</h3>

IVORNs that identify store points or files on store points can be resolved to locators
using the VoSpaceResolver.  The Resolver looks up the IVORN in the Registry and
Community services to find the relevent Store point, and returns a location in
the form of an AGSL. The Resolver also has convenience routines for opening
input and output streams directly to the file named by the IVORN.
<p>
[<i>The Resolver is a static 'helper' class; I think it is likely that it's functions
might be incorporated into VoSpaceClient (see below) but this is TBD. - MCH</i>]

<h3>Setting Results Targets</h3>

Defining where results are to be sent is slightly broader again than VOSpace (eg might include email), and
is TBD. [<i>The TargetIndicator in the datacenter project is the prototype for this - MCH</i>]

<h3>Levels of delegates</h3>
Lower level delegates are those such as soap binding delegates, FTP client software, etc.
<p>
A middle level delegate is a StoreClient implementation that users of this package
can use to manipulate files on a single Store point using paths and AGSLs.
<p>
A top level delegate VoSpaceClient is similar to a StoreClient but manipulates files in VO-Space
in general, using IVORNs.

<h3>Store Clients</h3>

The StoreClient interface defines the operations that we can reasonably expect any
store point must implement; operations such as move, copy, create folder,
list files, upload, download, etc.
<p>
A StoreClient implentation is a 'delegate', and it handles all the communication
required to carry out these operations with <i>a specific store site</i>.  This is
a 'middle level' delegate.  (There is an abstract class StoreDelegate which implements
some of the methods in a 'naive' way for convenience).
<p>
The core methods that store delegates must implement are providing input and output
streams to files, and listing files on the store point.
<p>
However users of this package do not need to care about implementations - if you
want to access a store point, you give your AGSL to the StoreClientFactory and
get back a StoreClient that you can operate.
<p>

<h3>VoSpace Clients</h3>

The VoSpaceClient is a class that allows operations 'in general' in VO-Space
using IVORNs.  This makes it a more abstract layer, and allows us to pass IVORNs
around our components and store them long term.  If a storepoint moves web address
and the Registry is updated, an IVORN should remain valid.
<p>
However VoSpaceClient limits operations to those storepoints that are Registered
(ie, those in VoSpace).
