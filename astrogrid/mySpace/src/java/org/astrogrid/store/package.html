The store package defines the representations and delegates used to describe and
access data in 'VO-Space' - store points on the web that can be reached by
VO-compliant components.

<h3>VO-Space</h3>

VO Space is the set of store points that we assume Astrogrid components must be
able to reach to read from and write to.  This includes local disk space, MySpace,
FTP servers (for read access at least), Grid FTP servers and Http servers (for read
access at least).
<p>
This package defines a consistent way of accessing all these store points, so that
the user (whether human or automatic) can specify where inputs are to be read from
and outputs are to be sent in a consistent way, and the software that is expected
to use these references can also just call methods on classes in this package
and expect everything to Just Work.

<h3>Naming things in VO-Space</h3>

The IVO have created a resource 'identifier' with the scheme <code>ivo:</code> .  Strictly
speaking this is a resource 'name' as they are intended as Registry lookup keys and cannot
be used as locators. These are called IVORNs (International Virtual Observatory Resource Names)
and are represented using the class <code>Ivorn</code>.

<h3>Locating things in VO-Space</h3>

A location in VO-Space might refer to a file on an FTP server, or a file on a local
disk, or a file in myspace. To represent this we have an AstroGrid Storepoint Locator (AGSL) that
returns a location to this file, which is represented in turn by the <code>Agsl</code> class.

<h3>Resolving Names to Locations</h3>

IVORNs that identify store points or files on store points can be resolved to locators
using the VoSpaceResolver.  The Resolver looks up the IVORN in the Registry and
Community services to find the relevent Store point, and returns a location in
the form of an AGSL. The Resolver also has convenience routines for opening
input and output streams directly to the file named by the IVORN.

<h3>Setting Results Targets</h3>

Defining where results are to be sent is slightly broader again than VOSpace (eg might include email), and
is TBD.

<h3>Store Clients</h3>

The StoreClient interface defines the operations that we can reasonably expect any
store point must be able to implement; operations such as move, copy, create folder,
list files, upload, download, etc.
<p>
A StoreClient implentation is a 'delegate', and it handles all the communication
required to carry out these operations with <i>a specific store site</i>.  This is
a 'middle level' delegate.
<p>
However users of this package do not need to care about implementations - if you
want to access a store point, you give your AGSL to the StoreClientFactory and
get back a StoreClient that you can operate.

<h3>Levels of delegates</h3>
Lower level delegates are those such as soap binding delegates, FTP client software, etc.
<p>
A middle level delegate is a StoreClient implementation that users of this package
can use to manipulate files on a single Store point using paths and AGSLs.
<p>
A top level delegate is similar to a StoreClient but manipulates files in VO-Space
in general, using IVORNs.  The VoSpaceResolver helps with this but it is not
complete.

<h3>VoSpace Clients</h3>
At some point we intend to make a VoSpaceClient that
will allow file manipulation entirely by IVORNs; that is copy, move, rename, etc
