           Generating the MySpace Manager Web Service Classes
           ==================================================


Some of the Web Service classes in the MySpace delegate and Manager, and
the corresponding WSDL and WSDD files, are generated semi-automatically.
This note describes the procedure to create these files.  These classes
allow the delegate and Manager to communicate via Web Services.

I wrote the note as an aide-memoire for myself, but I hope that it will
be useful to anyone else who needs to maintain or develop this
software.  I assume that you are familiar with AstroGrid practices and
procedures.  AstroGrid builds Web Services using Axis from the Apache
Software Foundation.  Further information can be found in the Axis user
and reference guides:

  http://ws.apache.org/axis/java/user-guide.html
  http://ws.apache.org/axis/java/reference.html

In the following procedure files are generated in the client part of the
MySpace directory tree.  Some of these files will need to be copied to
the manager tree, but this step is covered at the appropriate place in
the discussion [TODO].

I assume that you are set-up for developing MySpace, and have, for
example, the MySpace source tree and the Axis libraries on your CLASSPATH.

The starting point is a series of template Java classes, which have
file-type `.template'.  The individual template files are briefly
described in a subsequent section.  One of these templates
(Manager.template) defines the interface implemented by both the
`bottom level' of the delegate and the `top level' of the Manager.
Presumably this interface has changed (a method has been in added or
removed, or the arguments of one of the methods has changed), otherwise
you would not be reading this note in order to find out how to
re-generate the classes.

Most of the other templates correspond to Java beans, with only get and
set methods.  It is futile to add extra methods or constructors to these
templates.  When the Axis utilities generate the corresponding Java
classes from the templates they will not include any additional methods.


Procedure
---------

Proceed as follows.


1.  Set your current directory to:

       .../myspace/src/java/org/astrogrid/myspace/delegate

    (but since you are reading this note you have probably already done
    this).

2.  Type:

      source generate.csh

    generate.csh is a tc-shell script.  You can read it (and the scripts
    that it calls) to see the procedure that is actually being followed.
    A number of Java classes and WSDD and WSDL files will be created.

3.  A final, manual step is to edit file:

      .../myspace/src/webapp/WEB-INF/server-config.wsdd

    The procedure required seems to be (and I've found this by a process
    of trial and error, so take this with a pinch of salt):

  (a) Extract the complete <service> element with:

        name="astrogrid-myspace"

      from file deploy.wsdd created in the delegate directory.  Save
      this element as a temporary file.  Include all the child elements 
      (parameter, typeMapping).

  (b) Globally change `astrogrid-myspace' to `Manager' in the temporary
      copy.

  (c) Remove the existing <service> element with:

        name="Manager"

      from file:

        .../myspace/src/webapp/WEB-INF/server-config.wsdd

  (d) Insert the new replacement <service> element created in step (b).

4.  In the future is may be necessary to copy some of the Manager
    classes to a different directory.  [TODO]

5.  That's it.  Now build the MySpace client and Manager war files using
    maven and deploy them in the usual fashion.


Template files
--------------

The Web Service classes are created from the following template files.

- AstrogridMyspaceSoapBindingImpl.template
    Top level class for the Manager.

- EntryResults.template 
    Subsidiary class of returned results.

- KernelResults.template
    Top-level class of returned results.

- Manager.template
    Interface implemented by the top level Manager class and the bottom
    level class of the delegate.

- StatusResults.template
    Subsidiary class of returned results.


The following classes and templates implement Manager.template:

  AstrogridMyspaceSoapBindingImpl.template (and corresponding .java *)
  AstrogridMyspaceSoapBindingSkeleton      *
  AstrogridMyspaceSoapBindingStub.java     *
  ManagerFake.java

* - automatically generated, see below.


Generated Java Classes and WSDD files
-------------------------------------

The following Java classes should have been created:

  AstrogridMyspaceSoapBindingImpl.java        server
  AstrogridMyspaceSoapBindingSkeleton.java    server
  AstrogridMyspaceSoapBindingStub.java        client
  ManagerService.java                         client
  ManagerServiceLocator.java                  client

and the following two WSDD files:

  deploy.wsdd
  undeploy.wsdd


Classes Returned by the Delegate
--------------------------------

For simplicity, all the delegate methods (apart from heartBeat, which
returns a String) return a KernelResults object.  KernelResults is
a complex object including both arrays of status messages and results.
There are subsidiary classes for these internal items.

Both KernelResults and the subsidiary classes are generated from
templates.

SAY A BIT MORE ABOUT THIS?  [TODO]
