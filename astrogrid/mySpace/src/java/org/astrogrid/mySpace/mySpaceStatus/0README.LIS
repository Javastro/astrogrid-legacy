org/astrogrid/mySpace/mySpaceStatus
===================================


This directory holds the mySpace classes for status handling.  Most of
these classes are conventional java code.  However, MySpaceStatusCode.java
is different.  It is generated automatically from a template file and a
properties file which contains a list of the error codes in the mySpace
system.  The corresponding files are:

  template file:                                 ./MySpaceStatusCode.template
  properties file with error codes:
    ../../../../../../configFiles/ASTROGRID_myspacemanagermessages.properties

To change MySpaceStatusCode.java edit the template file rather than the
java file.  (Note that the template file can itself be compiled with a
java compiler.  This feature is provided as a de-bugging aid.)

To generate the java file from the template file run the Perl script
makeMySpaceStatusCode.pl.  Simply type:

  makeMySpaceStatusCode.pl

This script has no arguments; it automatically picks up the required
files.  A new MySpaceStatusCode.java will be created.  It is a standard
java file which can be compiled and built into the mySpace system in
the conventional way.


Introducing a new error code into the mySpace system
----------------------------------------------------

To introduce a new error code into the mySpace system edit it into:

  .../ASTROGRID_myspacemanagermessages.properties

Then regenerate MySpaceStatusCode.java as described above.  Note that:

* The error codes should conform to the AstroGrid conventions.  The
  error codes are forced to be unique; the resulting java class will
  not compile if there are duplicates.
     
* The description should be enclosed in double-quotes (").
     
* There should be no spaces on either side of the equals sign (=).
     
* Blank lines and comment lines (which start with a `#') may be
  introduced as required.
