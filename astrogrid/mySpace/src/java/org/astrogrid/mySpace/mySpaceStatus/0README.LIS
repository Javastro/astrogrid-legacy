org/astrogrid/mySpace/mySpaceStatus
===================================


This directory holds the mySpace classes for status handling.  Most of
these classes are conventional java code.  However, MySpaceStatusCode.java
is different.  It is generated automatically from a template file and a
properties file which contains a list of the error codes in the mySpace
system.  The corresponding files are:

  template file:                      MySpaceStatusCode.template
  properties file with error codes:   statuscodes.properties

To change MySpaceStatusCode.java edit the template file rather than the
java file.  (Note that the template file can itself be compiled with a
java compiler.  This feature is provided as a de-bugging aid.)

To generate the java file from the template file run the Perl script
makeMySpaceStatusCode.pl.  Simply type:

  makeMySpaceStatusCode.pl

This script has no arguments; it automatically picks up the required
files.  A new MySpaceStatusCode.java will be created.  It is a standard
java file which can be compiled and built into the mySpace system in
the conventional way.


Introducing a new error code into the mySpace system
----------------------------------------------------

To introduce a new error code into the mySpace system edit it into
statuscodes.properties.  Then regenerate MySpaceStatusCode.java as
described above.  Note that:

* The error codes are turned into a java variables and hence should
  conform to the naming conventions for java variables (for example,
  they should not contain embedded `-' characters).  Also, the error
  codes are forced to be unique; the resulting java class will not
  compile if there are duplicates.
     
* The description should be enclosed in double-quotes (").
     
* There should be no spaces on either side of the equals sign (=).
     
* Blank lines and comment lines (which start with a `#') may be
  introduced as required.
