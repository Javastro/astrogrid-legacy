      <p>
         The integration tests are executed as a maven project which is executed by a shell script
         maven-integration-tests.sh which lives in /mavenrun.
         The integration tests consist of a number of <a href ="junit-report.html">JUnit tests</a>.

      <p>
         The maven builds produce wars for  all components.  Before the integration tests are run these wars are grabbed
         from the repository and (re-)deployed to a variety of test machines.  You can find out what goes where by looking at the ant 
         script deployWebapps.xml.
