<P>
AstroGrid components are continuously integrated and tested using a Maven script that has to come to be known
as AGINAB (AstroGrid-IN-A-Box).  As well as being used for testing, AGINAB is also a handy way to quickly 
deploy and configure a test set of AstroGrid components on a single machine.

<P>
For the latest integration test results and instructions on how you can use AGINAB please follow the links to the left.
