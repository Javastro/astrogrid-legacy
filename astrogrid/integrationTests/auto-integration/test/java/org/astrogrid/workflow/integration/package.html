	<h1>Integration tests for core workflow functionality</h1>
	This package contains tests  that exercise the JES server. Many of the constuct workflow documents containing calls to test applications, submit them to jes, 
	and then examine the results. The test applications themsevles
	should have already been verified as working by the tests in the {@link prg.astrogrid.applications.integration} hierarchy.
	<p>
		At the moment, jes has no method of notifying a listener when job execution is complete - the client has to poll instead. Furthermore, because of the
		concurrent nature of JES, it's possible that a workflow is paused / delayed in execution - this may mean that the occasional workflow test times out, or that a
		failure in one test class affects subsequent tests. There's not a lot that can be done about this.
