	<h1>Internal tests of url parsing and fetch tool used in the SIAPIntWFS workflow</h1>
	This package contains tests of the siap-url-parse-n-fetch tool, and an inline-script equivalent.
	They are both exercised against a locally held votable (previously downloaded fromo SIAPIntWFS) whose
	url references have been edited to point to local files (again previouly download from SIAPIntWFS)
	. However, the structure of the votable metadata - which is the importatant part for the
	parsing tasks -  is unchanged.
	<p />
    See {@link org.astrogrid.workflow.externaldep.intwfssiap} for integration tests using the real external service.
