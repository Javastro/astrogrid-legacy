	<h1>Integration tests for Solar Event science case that require external resources</h1>
	
		twmbarlwm is configured to run these tests, while by default, other systems aren't.
		<p>
	These tests use / call resources that are external to the single-server astrogrid-in-a-box. They've been put in a separate package, that
	won't be run in the integration tests by default - as they're not going to work on a laptop with no net connection. Also, we
	don't want multiple instances of the tests hammering these services constantly.
