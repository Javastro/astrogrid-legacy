	<h1>Integration tests for Solar Event science case that require external resources</h1>
	These tests use / call resources that are external to the single-server astrogrid-in-a-box. They've been put in a separate package, that
	won't be run in the integration tests by default.
	<p>
		todo - enable these tests on twmbarlwm.
