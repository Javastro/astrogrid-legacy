	<h1>Integration tests for core CEA server component (and Java Applications)</h1>
	
	Most tests in this package hierarchy extend {@link org.astrogrid.application.integration.AbstractRunTestForCEA} and use
	an instance of {@link org.astrogrid.application.integration.ServerInfo} to capture specifcs of connecting to a different application server.
	<p>
		This hierarchy repeats the same set of tests for each flavour of cea server (java / commandline / datacenter / http). These are an installation test, a
		 direct-parameter test, file-indirect parameter test and vospace-indirect parameter test. There may be addiional tests on top.
		 
		 <p />
		 The repeated tests ensure that each server flavour behaves in a uniform way, and may be subclassed by new server types. The specifics of testing
		 a particular server type are captured in an instance of {@link org.astrogrid.application.integration.ServerInfo}
