Please follow these instructions on your laptop / desktop machine to allow your account on the astro-XX.flexiscale.metagrid.co.uk machines to update the scripts checked out from cvs without needing to enter a password.

This relies on your public key being on the *.flexiscale.metagrid.co.uk machines and you accessing it using it's *.flexiscale.metagrid.co.uk name and not IP address.


Add these two lines to /etc/ssh/ssh_config on your own machine:

Host *.flexiscale.metagrid.co.uk
   ForwardAgent yes

as root:
/etc/init.d/ssh reload

as yourself:
eval `ssh-agent`
ssh-add
