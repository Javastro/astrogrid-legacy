<h1>Info</h1><br />
STAP (Simple Time Access Protocol) - will most likely change its name in the 
near future since IVOA is talking about 'Simple Table Access Protocol'.  This protocol is used to 
display give back data that is based on Time typically Images such as Fits and Time-Series such as CDF.
Please Note at this time SIA (Simple Image Access Protocol) does not handle 'just time' but is expected to
in the next version whereby SIA2 is what will be used to fetch data.  Till then use this experimental
protocol.
<br /><br />
<h1>Current Draft</h1><br />
Current Working Draft Spec can be found: <a href='stap.html'>here</a>
<br /><br />
<h1>Installation</h1><br />
To begin installing and connecting STAP to your database you must do 3 things:<br />
<ul>
<li>a.)Find a suitable jdbc driver for your database and  place it where the webapp can find it.
  (This is typically in the webapps/{context name}/WEB-INF/lib or a common/lib for your servlet container like tomcat/common/lib whereby all webapps have access to those libraries.)</li>
<li>b.) Read and Edit the astrogrid.properties file in the webapps/{context name}/WEB-INF/classes directory.</li>
<li>b.) Read and Edit the regmetadata.properties file in the webapps/{context name}/WEB-INF/classes directory.</li>
<li>d.) Restart your servlet container or webapp via the manager. (if you put the jdbc driver in common/lib then a restart of the servlet container is required.)</li>
</ul>
<br />
You may now test your service by doing various requests; sample url:<br />
http://{your domain}/{your context}/StapSearch?START=2006-02-08T00:00:00&END=2006-02-08T15:00:00
<br /><ul>
<li>d.)Once you verify things are working then the final thing is to upload a registration entry into your publishing
registry so other registries can find and use your service.  Currently this is a manual process the registry administrator
should do or somebody who has the ability to upload data into the registry.<br />
You will find XML that needs to be updated into the registry here:<br />
0.10 -  <a href="MetaDataXML0_10.jsp">Here</a><br />
1.0 -  <a href="MetaDataXML1_0.jsp">Here</a><br />
 </li>
 </ul>
 <br />
 <h1>Important Notes:</h1><br />
 <ul>
 <li>
 If your looking for generating data from Fits files such as sql to go into your database see the fitstosql tool.
 Located here <a href='http://www.astrogrid.org/maven/org.astrogrid/zips/astrogrid-tools-fitstosql-1.0.zip'>here</a>
