Description of Workbench Testing.
======================
Different kinds of tests.
Unit
Integration
System

Unit Tests
======
Tests a single class in isolation.
 Tests are repeatable
Named xxxUnitTest.java
Added to a AllUnitTests.java suite
Should test a class in isolation, outside the hivemind / workbench framework. 
No external resources or network services should be called.
Other dependencies should be mocked or stubbed.
If a component needs to fetch a url, provide a classpath resource and pass it  the url of that.

Integration Tests
===========
Tests integration of components within the hivemind container.
Tests are repeatable.
Named xxxIntegrationTest.java
Added to a AllIntegrationTests.java suite
Should test a class within the hivemind / workbench framework -either via its public interface,
or other backdoors.
No external resources  or services to be called.
Other dependencies should be provided by hivemind


System Tests
=========
Tests operation of workbench calling remote services.
Repeatability depends on whether remote services are available.
Named xxxSystemTest.java
Added to a AllSystemTests.java suite
Should test a class within the hivemind / workbench framework.


Subdivisions of System Test
============
PerformanceSystemTest - a test that loads or times the system (not to destruction)
UISystemTest - user interface testing


Other Tests
=========
TransportTest - tests that same funcitonality is available (i.e. data can be accessed) 
using the xmlrpc / rmi interface.

Destructive tests - e.g. Stress testing, to be named as such, and kept distinct from other tests
- as can't really generate reports from these, and will mess up any kind of build.s
