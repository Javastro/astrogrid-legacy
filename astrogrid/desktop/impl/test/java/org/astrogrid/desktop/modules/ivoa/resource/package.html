<h1> Tests for resource parser and formatter.</h1>

Tests for the resource parser (converts xml reg entries to data structures) and formatter
(converts data structure to html), where the inputs are real-world registry entries, warts and all,
chosen from the AG main registry. I've tried to choose some complete, and some poorly
formed, to check that the code works on all, and doesn't choke on semi-legal data.
<p>
When resources are found in the wild that cause the parser or formatter to fail, they
should be added to this test suite. The commonest form of failure is a nullPointerException
in the formatter, when a field which is expected to be there does not occur in an entry,
or contains some kind of invalid value.
<p>
The tests are arranged in a hierarchy that mirrors the inheritance hierarchy of Resource - 
in this way much test code and assertions can be reused.
