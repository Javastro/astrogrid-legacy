<section name="Background Processes">
<p>
This window is accessed from the menubar as 'window > show background processes', or by clicking the activity throbber
at the bottom left hand corner of any window. The window shows some subset of the currently running background processes (i.e. running instances of
<tt>org.astrogrid.desktop.modules.ui.BackgroundWorker</tt>.
</p>
<p>
When instantiating <tt>BackgroundWorker</tt>, a parent must be provided - either the owning window (a <tt>UIComponent</tt>) or the general <tt>UIContext</tt>.
The parentage of background workers is used to categorize them.
</p>
<p>
Each item listed in the BackgroundProcesses window is a running background task. Buttons are provided to abort the task, and also to pop it out into it's own
progress window. There's also facility for the background process to indicate how much progress it has made, and provide status messsages. Progress information
 and status messages are provided by the background worker subclass calling <tt>org.astrogrid.desktop.modules.ui.BackgroundWorker.setProgress(int, int)</tt>
  and <tt>org.astrogrid.desktop.modules.ui.BackgroundWorker.reportProgress(String)</tt>
 respectively.
</p>
<p>
See the javadoc for BackgroundWorker for more information on how to implement worker threads.
