<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>
VO Lookout is a tool for monitoring and controlling processes - queries, remote tool execution, and 
workflows. It uses the metaphor of an email program - each process is represented by a separate folder,
which contains messages, information, results about this process.
</p>
<p>
As well as tracking execution progress and accessing results, Lookout can also create, stop and delete
processes.
