<h2>Quick Overview</h2><br>
<p>
AstroScope is a new tool based around the ideas of the popular NVO Datascope.  AstroScope will allow you to put in position
 or object in the sky along with a region.  As a query is submitted a process is started looking up varous Catalogue and
 Image servers asking them for data based around the query.  If results are found then information is displayed in a 
 graphical form on the screen allowing the you the user to surf the various nodes (or bubbles) looking at the results.  
By default you view things in the "Radial" view requiring a 'click of the mouse (leftbutton)' to browse up and down the various nodes,
another option is the 'Hyperbolic' view which shows everything in a tree state where by a click of the mouse re-centers the selected node.
 The user  may then select a particular object to have the data (including images) saved to Myspace or there computer.  
See below for all the various actions.<br>

<br>
<h2>Button Action</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Submit</b> -- starts the processing of the query based on the position/object and region size.</li>
<li><b>Save</b> -- Only enabled when selected data is present.  Brings up a box allowing you to save to myspace or your
local computer. <font color='blue'>You MUST choose a directory</font> this is because of multiple files are saved.  Hence
unique file names will be saved in the appropriate directory.</li>
<li><b>Go to Top</b> -- results in bringing in the focus of the top node 'Search Results'.  Currently only for the 'Radial'
view.
</ul>
<br>
<h2>Graphical Actions</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Single Click (leftmousebutton)</b> -- results in re-centering the desired node to the center of the graph.  In the 'Radial'
window it will expand any information/children of that node.</li>
<li><b>Double Click (leftmousebutton)</b> -- results in selection of that node and all its children.  You may select the
'Search Results' node (the top) if you desire everything.</li>
<li><b>Left Mouse Button (Dragged/Hold Down)</b> -- results in panning around the graph, this may be desirable on a lot of results.</li>
<li><b>Right Mouse Button (Dragged/Hold Down)</b> -- results in zooming the display.  Hold Down the right mouse button and scroll up for
