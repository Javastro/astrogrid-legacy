    <p>
    Each of the activities listed can be dragged into the tree panel and used to construct complex workflows, simply
    hold down the left mouse button whilst the cursor is over the required activity to start the drag operation, and release the button to drop it.<br> 
    Tooltips are available for each activity to explain what it does (these can be turned off under the preferences option).
    <p>
    Activities that are containers i.e. <b>sequence</b> and <b>flow</b> can contain any number of other activities, if an attempt
    is made to drop an activity onto any other activities the builder will attempt to insert the dragged activity above the target location.<br>
    Some drag and drop operations are not permitted, for example
    an <b>else</b> activity can only be dropped onto either an <b>if</b>or <b>then</b> to form a correct if/then/else operation.
