<h1>Workflow builder: tree view</h1>
    The workflow tree is used to create, manipulate and view workflow objects. 
    The tree can display a vast amount of information about your workflow, no matter how complex it may be:
    <p>
      <center> 
        <img src="../../org/astrogrid/desktop/icons/workflowTree.png" alt="Tree panel" > 
      </center>
    <p>
    Activities can be dragged into the tree from the activities list, and can be moved around once in the tree
    using either drag and drop or the activity move buttons 
    <img src="../../org/astrogrid/desktop/icons/promote.gif" alt="promote" >
    <img src="../../org/astrogrid/desktop/icons/demote.gif" alt="demote" >. 
    The tree can be expanded and collapsed using the
    <img src="../../org/astrogrid/desktop/icons/collapse.gif" alt="collapse" >
    <img src="../../org/astrogrid/desktop/icons/expand.gif" alt="expand" > buttons.
    The tree view will scroll automatically during a drag and drop operation if the tree is larger than the available space.<br>
    An activity can be deleted either by dragging and dropping it onto the <img src="../../org/astrogrid/desktop/icons/redcross.gif" alt="red cross" >, or
    by clicking it and pressing the <img src="../../org/astrogrid/desktop/icons/redcross.gif" alt="delete" > button on the menu bar.<br>
    The tree may also be manipulated using cut, copy and paste; 
    <img src="../../org/astrogrid/desktop/icons/cut_edit.gif" alt="cut" >
    <img src="../../org/astrogrid/desktop/icons/copy.gif" alt="copy" >
    <img src="../../org/astrogrid/desktop/icons/paste_edit.gif" alt="paste" >
    <p>
    Double clicking an activity will open an editor screen that will allow you to edit that particular activity.
