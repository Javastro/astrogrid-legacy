<p>
The AstroGrid Workbench is a client side application that comprises a 
set of User tools which provide access to Virtual Observatory services. The 
tools include a Datasource explorer (AstroScope), Workflow builder, a VOStore explorer, Query and
Process manager (VO Lookout), 
Registry querying tool etc as well as the capability to call single 
services (SIAP, CEA, ConeSearch etc). In addition, Workbench provides 
 helper functions such as the Sesame name resolver, coordinate 
transformation tools, Vizier and UCD tools etc.
</p>
<p>
The workbench is layered upon the Astro Client Runtime (ACR), a set of high level APIs to 
any registered IVOA compliant service, offering the fastest and easiest 
way for Astronomers and VO tool developers to gain programmatic access to IVOA 
resources.  The ACR provides a high-level facade into AstroGrid services, accessible
		from HTTP / XML-RPC / JavaRmi and Gui interfaces. 
It provides a single sign-on, single-configuration, and single cache for interactions with astrogrid servers -
simplifying access to VO services.
