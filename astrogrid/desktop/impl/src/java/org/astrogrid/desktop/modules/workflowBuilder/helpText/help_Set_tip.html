  The <b>set</b> element is an activity that defines a new workflow variable,<br> 
  or updates the value of an existing variable. It has two attributes: <br>
  <b>&nbsp;var</b> - the name of the workflow variable (required);<br> 
  <b>&nbsp;value</b> - the value to set this variable to (optional). <br>
  If no value is provided, the variable is created and set to null. <br>
  The value attribute may be a straight literal string, or a script expression.
