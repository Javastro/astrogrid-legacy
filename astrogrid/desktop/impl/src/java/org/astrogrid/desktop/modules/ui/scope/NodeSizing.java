/**
 * Class that adjusts size of nodes in display
 * @author Kevin Benson
 *
 *@modified nww - refactoered as an enumeration type - each kind of node sizing
 *is a constant, and so no more than 3 node sizing objects are ever created
 *
 *@todo at the moment, node sizing is computed over all services.
 *Not only is this quite expensive, it's also not clear whether it gives good results
 * - maybe node sizing by service would give a better presentation (would be more efficient too)
