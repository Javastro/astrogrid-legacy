<h1>User Interface Components, and base classes</h1>

This package contains the implementation of the mini-applications of the workbench. 
<p>
	All mini-applications extend from {@link UIComponent}, and perform requests to VO services and other long-running
	operations in {@link BackgroundWorker} instances. This ensures that : there's a consistent look-n-feel; the UI remains responsive; and 
	improvements to these base classes benefit all the mini-applications.
