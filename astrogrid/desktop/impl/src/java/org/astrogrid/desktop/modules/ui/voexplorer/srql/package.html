<h1>SRQL - Simple Registry Query Language</h1>
The package defines a simple reigstry query language. Syntax is 
quite free-form and inspired by google query language.

There's a parser (SRQLParser) that returns parsed phrases of the SRQL language - which 
will be a subtype of the SRQL base class.

The SRQL terms implement the visitor pattern, to allow XQueries, and other things, to 
be generated from them.
