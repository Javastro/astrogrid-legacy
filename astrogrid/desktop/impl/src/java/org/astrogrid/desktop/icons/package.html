<h1>Icons</h1>
This package contains the icon files, plus code to assist with loading them
<p/>
All new icons should be taken from the 'crystal clear' collection,
downloadable from http://www.everaldo.com/crystal.html
<p/>
rename the icon where it makes things clearer.
suffixed with '16', '32', etc to indicate its dimensions.
<p/>
There's probably some unused icons in this package, which should be cleared out.
