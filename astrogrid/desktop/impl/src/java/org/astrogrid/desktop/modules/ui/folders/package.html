<h1>Persistent Folder Models</h1>

This package provides a framework of 'folders', 
with subclasses for lists of resources, smart resource folders (queries)
and disk-folders.
<p/>
This package also  defines persistence mechanisms for trees and lists of folders.
These allow collections of folders to be pre-populated, loaded and saved to disk.
<p/>
These collections of folders are intended to be used as a shared model between
many views (be it resource folders in voexplorer, storage locations in filemanager, or search history in astroscope)
The persistence mechanism listens to changes to the folders list,
and writes back to disk on every modification.
