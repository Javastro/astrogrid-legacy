<h1>Persistent Folder Models</h1>

This package provides a framework of 'folders', 
with subclasses for lists of resources, smart resource folders (queries)
and disk-folders.
<p/>
This package also  defines persistence mechanisms for lists of folders.
These allow a list of folders to be pre-populated, loaded and saved to disk.
<p/>
These lists of folders are iintended to be used as a shared model between
many instances of voexplorer (which forms the view).
The persistence mechanism listens to changes to the folders list,
and writes back to disk on every modification.
