    <h3>Welcome to the Workflow viewer ( builder to follow... )</h3>
    At present you can: 
    <ul>
      <li>load and save workflows from either your MySpace or local file system</li>
      <li>view workflows in either a tree form or document form</li>
      <li>submit workflows to the Job Entry System</li>
      <li>look at details of tasks within the registry</li>
      <li>search for specific tasks within the registry</li>
    </ul> 
    Beta changes: drag and drop has been added, this is still to be improved/tested and has no
    effect on the workflow object you are viewing/creating. This is still basically a workflow viewer at present....
