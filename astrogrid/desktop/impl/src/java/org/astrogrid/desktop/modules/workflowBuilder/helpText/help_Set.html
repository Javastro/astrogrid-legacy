  The <b>set</b> element is an activity that defines a new workflow variable, or updates the value of an existing variable.<br>
  It has two attributes: <b>var</b> - the name of the workflow variable (required); <b>value</b> - the value to set this variable to (optional).
  If no value is provided, the variable is created and set to null.
  The value attribute may be a straight literal string, or a script expression.
