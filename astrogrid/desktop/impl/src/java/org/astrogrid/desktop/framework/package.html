<h1>Framework of the ACR</h1>

The Astrogird Client Runtime is assembled from a set of distinct modules, described by xml <tt>module.xml</tt> files. This package defines the 
core framework of the runtime, that handles the reading, assembly and instanitation of these modules.
<p/>

Each module is represented by an instance of the {@link Module} class - probably the default implementation {@lnk DefaultModule}.
Module instances are managed in a {@link ModuleRegistry} - again, probably implemented by {@link DefaultMOduleRegistry}.

The registry is populated on startup by {@link Bootloader} which contains a list of module.xml files to parse. In future, this will be extensible, but at the moment 
it is hard-coded.
