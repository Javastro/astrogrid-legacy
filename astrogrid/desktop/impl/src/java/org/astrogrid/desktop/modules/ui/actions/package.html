<h1>UI Activities</h1>

<b>Activities</b> are operations that can be performed on the user's current selection - one or more resources (in voexplorer),
files (in filemanager), or query results (in astroscope and taskrunner).
<p/>
Activities appear within the window menus, and also in the <i>Activities Pane</i>, which shows a changing list of 
activities suitable to the current selection.
<p/>
Each activity is implemented by a separate class, most of which are in this package. They all must implement the 
{@link org.astrogrid.desktop.modules.ui.actions.Activity} interface. The baseclass is 
{@link org.astrogrid.desktop.modules.ui.actions.AbstractActivity}.

<p/> 

Activities are managed by 
the {@link org.astrogrid.desktop.modules.system.ui.ActivitiesManager}, and assembled using hivemind.
