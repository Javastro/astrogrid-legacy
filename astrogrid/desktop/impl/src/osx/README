This directory contains files for building the application bundle for Mac OSX.

The file VODesktopStub is a renamed copy of 
/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Resources/MacOS/JavaApplicationStub
from a machine running osX 10.5.6.  The renaming isn't essential, but
makes it easier to spot the VODesktop process running on a Mac e.g. 
when using top.

An application bundle built using this file is expected to be capable
of running on other versions of the OS (I think), but it is conceivable 
that it might need to be updated at some point with a copy from a 
future version of OSX.  If things get hairier than that (backward
compatibility issues) see also the symlink trick in the jarbundler 
web pages:
