<section name="Overview">
	
	<p>
		This project implements a desktop service which other client-side applications can connect with
		to interact with astrogrid. At present supports HTTP / XML-RPC / Gui interfaces to astrogrid client-side components.
		Plan to add Java-RMI imminently. Maybe CORBA later.
	</p>
	<p>
		The client runtime provides a single sign-on, single-configuration, and single cache for interactions with astrogrid servers -
		making implementation of client-side applications simpler.
	</p>
	<p>
		The runtime provides client-side components for accessing the basic functionality of each of the astrogrid services -
		myspace, registry, jes, cea, community. It also provides GUI components - simple dialogues that can be reused by client applications
		to perform common tasks (myspace microbrowser, registry browser, etc). Finally, the runtime provides a series of simple GUI applications that
		act as reference implementations for GUIs for the core features of astrogrid - myspace browser, job controller, registry browser. Others to follow - workflow
		builder, query builder, cea invoker.
