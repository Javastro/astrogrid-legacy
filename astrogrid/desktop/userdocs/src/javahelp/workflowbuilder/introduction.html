    <h1>Workflow: Introduction</h1>
      A workflow aims to accomplish a complex piece of work. 
      In Astrogrid terms this would be an astronomical investigation. If the work could be done in one simple step (eg: by executing a single program from the command line), then it would hardly be a workflow. A prime dimension of a workflow is therefore that the objective will take more than one step to accomplish - it has a degree of complexity.
      A simple example of a workflow might consist of the following steps:
      <ol>
        <li>Make a query against against one catalog (say a cone search of one area of the sky).</li>
        <li>Make a similar query against another catalog.</li>
        <li>Merge the contents.</li>
        <li>Analyse the resulting data.</li>
      </ol>
      Each step is usually the invocation of a separate computer program (a task), each task requiring its own inputs and outputs. 
      Some inputs to a step will be astronomical data, and some inputs will be control information for the selected tool. 
      Outputs will normally be processed data destined as a final result, or as intermediate data to be used as inputs for subsequent steps within the workflow.
      For Astrogrid, the final result of executing a workflow is usually a file held in MySpace. 
      From that viewpoint, Astrogrid workflow is itself an intermediate tool, 
      since we would envisage the final results file being subsequently loaded into another tool, for example, for visualization, or even for input into a different workflow.
      Astrogrid tries to deal with the complexity of workflows. But it is not an easy thing to eliminate. 
      We hold workflow designs as XML documents. This is a particularly verbose way of describing an individual workflow, 
      but is convenient for its rigour. There is no necessity to interact directly with a workflow xml document 
      and therefore there is no necessity to be intimately equainted with it; the workflow builder hides most of the intricacies.
