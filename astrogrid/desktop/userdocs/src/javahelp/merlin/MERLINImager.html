<h2><a name="Summary"> Summary </a></h2>
<p>
The <a href="http://www.merlin.ac.uk/astrogrid/MerlinImager/www.merlin.ac.uk">MERLIN</a> radio interferometry
archive contains visibility data.  If an observation has been suitably
calibrated, an image can be extracted on demand from anywhere in the
field of view. 
</p>
<p>
See <a href="http://www.merlin.ac.uk/user_guide/OnlineMUG/">The MERLIN
User Guide</a> for more information about MERLIN data
reduction. Please credit AstroGrid and use the <a href="http://www.merlin.ac.uk/astrogrid/MerlinImager/www.merlin.ac.uk/archive/acknowledge.html">acknowledgement</a>in
any publications.
</p>

<h3><a name="Datasets">  Available Datasets </a></h3>
<p>
At present (Spring 2006) the MERLIN archive contains processed data
taken between 1992-2000, in the 1.3-1.7 and 4-7 GHz bands (22-17 and
6-5 cm wavelength, or L- and C-band). More data are being added. The
field of view of an individual pointing is usually 1-10 arcmin radius,
around an object of interest.  Click on "Browse MERLIN Archive List"
in <a href="http://www.merlin.ac.uk/archive/archive_form.html">MERLIN
Archive Search Form</a> to see a list of all objects/positions covered
in the archive, or search for individual objects. If a source is of
type <tt>Target</tt> or <tt>Phase ref.</tt>then it should be possible
to extract an image
</p>
<p>
Up to 5 images per position will be returned (prioritised by
the likely quality) in the form of a list of URLs pointing to FITS
files, which you can manipulate or download.

A VOTable containing a list of image URLs will be returned to
MySpace. The table also gives basic information like position, size
and pixel size.  You can view the table in TopCat and copy the URLs to
download the FITS files, or you can load the VOTable into Aladin and
view the images directly, or you can send to URLs to any service which
understands them, e.g. the AstroGrid-wrapped SExtractor (with suitable
configuration files).  <a href="http://www.merlin.ac.uk/astrogrid/GettingAndViewingData/GettingAndViewingData.html">Getting and
Viewing Data</a> describes this more fully.  The screenshot below
shows the use of <a href="http://www.merlin.ac.uk/astrogrid/MerlinImager/aladin.u-strasbg.fr/java/nph-aladin">Aladin</a>.  Use the
<strong>PLASTIC</strong> menu to register the service and then
<strong>LOAD</strong> the VOTable produced by the MERLIN Imager from
your MySpace. In this example the top two images were produce by the
Imager at 4993 and 1658 GHz respectively; the bottom images are a
false colour composite and a higher resolution (VLBI) image, all with
the 4993-GHz contours overlaid.

<h2><a name="Usage_Notes"> </a><a name="Usage_Notes_"> </a> Usage Notes: </h2>

<h3><a name="Troubleshooting"> </a> Troubleshooting </h3>
<p>
If you choose a very large image size (over about 20 (80) arcsec at
around 5 (1.4) GHz) it may take a long time. Smaller images (e.g. 10
arcsec) should only take minutes to tens of minutes before the output
table appears in MySpace The most likely reason if no images are
returned after several hours is that there are no suitable data in the
region selected; check <a href="http://www.merlin.ac.uk/archive/archive_form.html">MERLIN
Archive Search Form</a>.  See the Development section below for known
issues.
</p>
<p>
Occasionally images may fail or be poor quality due to bad observing
conditions, interference or other problems (such as the presence of a
bright source on the edge of the selected image area).  Please report
any problems to merlin_archive@jb.man.ac.uk.
</p>







<h3><a name="How_it_works"> </a> How it works </h3>
<p>
The imaging service applies the calibration, Fourier
transforms and CLEANs the visibility data.  If the requested position
is far from the original pointing centre, that is also CLEANed out to
avoid confusion.  
</p>
<p> Resolution (restoring beam size) is adjusted by data weighting to
give a resolution as close to the user preference as possible. It will
be elongated for observations at low Dec.  At minimum resolution,
noise may be increased and sensitivity to extended structures is
reduced.  The natural beamsize usually gives a good balance of low
noise and sensitivity to (few) hundred-mas-scale structures.  The
upper limit is the maximum spatial scale of imageable data (determined
by the shortest baseline).  
</p>
<p> There may be artefacts/sidelobes,
especially at low Dec. or for observations with reduced coverage
(short duration and/or antennas missing).  This will be more
pronounced at the highest resolutions allowed for the frequency, and
extended emission may be broken up.  If your image is many arcmin from
the original centre it may be distorted.  
</p>
<p>
This service uses the AstroGrid CEA and the <a href="http://www.radionet-eu.org/rnwiki/ParselTongue">ParselTongue</a>
scripting language  developed by RadioNet to control the AIPS data
reduction package.
The output VOTable is consistent with the Simple Image Access
Protocol, so that it is recognised by Aladin and other VO services.

<h2><a name="Development">Development </a>  </h2>
<p>
These are some of the issues which we hope to address (either via
AstroGrid or via MERLIN):
</p>
<ol>
<li>Link to SIMBAD to allow the use of standard source names as well
 as positions and MERLIN names.</li>
<li>Return a list of all fields observed by MERLIN covering the
 requested position, not just images of the top 5.</li>
<li>Improve the description of the coverage of the MERLIN archive so
 that it is easier to see if your region of interest has been observed
 and at what frequencies.</li>
<li>Return useful error messages.</li>
<li>Increase the amount of imaging data available</li>
<li>Add services to return visibility data and other data products
 such as spectra, time series and data cubes, and polarization images.</li>
</ol>
