<h1>Lookout</h1>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>
Lookout monitors the progress of jobs running on the AstroGrid system
and allows to display the results.
</p>

<h2>1. Background</h2>

<p>
Whenever you execute an Application (see

<a href="ApplicationLauncher.html">Application Launcher</a>)
or 
Workflow (see
<a href="WorkflowBuilder.html">Workflow Builder</a>)
on the AstroGrid system, a Lookout window opens for you to
monitor their progress.
</p>

<h2>2. Monitoring job progress</h2>

<p>
If you used the <a href="ApplicationLauncher.html">Application Launcher</a>
to submit and query to a data centre, click the '+' next to 
<tt>Queries</tt>
to display a list of your queries. 
Similarly if you submitted a tool using the 

<a href="ApplicationLauncher.html">Application Launcher</a>
click the '+' next to <tt>Tasks</tt> and if you submitted a Workflow, click 
the '+' next to <tt>Workflows</tt>.

Clicking on one of the names in any of the lists 
displays in the right hand side panel the information on the job execution.
</p>

<p>
Lookout will automatically refresh, but you can also refresh manually
by clicking on the refresh icon. To delete a transcript from the list,
highlight it and choose the Delete icon).
</p>


<h2>3. Viewing a job transcript and results</h2>

<p>
If the job completed successfully, the last entry under <tt>Subject</tt>
will be <tt>Results</tt>. Click on this entry and the results will be listed
in the bottom right panel of the window.
</p>

<p>
If you submitted a Query and did not require the output to be saved into
a file on your Local Disk or MySpace, you can visualise the table
of results of your query, by clicking on the glasses icon under <tt>View</tt>.
If you submitted a Query and did require the output to be saved into
a file, go to MySpace or your local disk to view the votable. 
</p>

<p>

If you submitted a Workflow, by clicking on the glasses icon under
<tt>View</tt>, you will see a transcript of the execution of your 
workflow. You can save the transcript and reload it later by choosing
'Load a Workflow or Transcript'.
