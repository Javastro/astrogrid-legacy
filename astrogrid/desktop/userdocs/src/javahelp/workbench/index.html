<h1>Workbench - main window</h1>
The first window displayed by the workbench is an menu containing links to launch
different User Interface components of the workbench suite.

<h2>Advanced Users</h2>
If you drag the divider on the left-hand side of the window, you'll see a selection of buttons - 'Astrogrid', 'NVO', 'CDS', etc. Each of these buttons displays a 
separate pane of lower-level operations for accessing virtual observatory services. Most will prompt the user for one or two input parameters, perform a simple 
operation and then display the results. Most of this functionality is available in a more user-friendly manner from the main user interface components - however, 
the low-level operations are useful for trying out things when writing scripts.

These operations are also available from the <tt>Modules</tt> menu.
