<h1>Application launcher</h1>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>
Use the Application Launcher to execute a single task on the AstroGrid system.
A task can be either <strong>querying an archive for data</strong>
or <strong>running a tool</strong> 
that, for example, operates on data files or runs a model.
</p>

<h2>1. Background</h2>

<p>
Any application that is registered as a Common Execution Architecture (CEA)
application on the AstroGrid system can be launched via this interface.
Broadly speaking, CEA applications can be grouped into two groups:
those that <strong>execute queries to data archives</strong> (Section 2.1) and those that 
<strong>run a tool</strong> (Section 2.2).    
</p>

<h2>2. Selecting the application</h2>

<p>
Type a search term (case insensitive) into the <tt>Find:</tt> box and
click on <tt>Search</tt> (more details on options for this registry
search can be found at
<a href="http://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/s.dalla/astrogrid/documentation/RegistryBrowser.html">Registry Browser</a>). 
This will display a list of applications that
match the search. Clicking one of the names in 
the list displays registry information on the application. 
Clicking the box to the 
left of the name selects the application, and takes the user to a
new window where inputs to the application can be specified.
(To go back to the list of applications click on <tt>Chooser</tt>).
</p>

<h3>2.1 Querying data archives</h3>

<p>
Several applications are available to search archives for data. 
There are three ways in which a user can query for data: ADQL 
queries, cone searches and SIAP (Simple Image Access Protocol)
requests. Depending on the dataset required, one or more of
these options may be available.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Note</strong>: if you want to search multiple archives of
Astronomy data for a specified position in the sky or object, use
AstroScope. If you want to search multiple archives of Heliospheric data
for a given time range, use HelioScope.  
</p>

<p>
To send a query a data center, use the name of the dataset you
require as search term, and view the details of the applications
found, by clicking on their names.
</p>

<h4>2.1.1 ADQL queries</h4>

<p>
If an application in the list has a parameter described as 
<em>Astronomy Data Query Language that defines the search criteria</em>,
you can query the dataset using an ADQL query. 
When you select the application you will be taken to the 
<a href="http://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/s.dalla/astrogrid/documentation/QueryBuilder.html">Query Builder</a>
window, where you can construct the query
and then submit it.

<h4>2.1.2 Cone searches</h4>

<p>
When a Cone Search service is selected, a dialogue box will appear asking
for the central position and search radius (usually in decimal degrees).
</p>


<h4>2.1.3 SIAP</h4>

<p>
If an application in the list is described as SIAP service, then it
is possible to query the corresponding dataset using a standard
protocol: the Simple Image Access Protocol (SIAP). Mandatory parameters
for a SIAP call are the position in the sky (RA and Dec) to be
searched and Size of the search region.
</p>

<h3>2.2 Tools</h3>

<p>
If you require a specific tool that operates on the data or runs a model,
enter a search term and select it from the list displayed.
Documentation on AstroGrid tools can be found at <a href="http://wiki.astrogrid.org/bin/view/Astrogrid/ToolDocumentation">ToolDocumentation</a>.

<h2>3. Specifying parameters for the application</h2>

<p>
You will need to specify input and output parameters for the application.
Different applications require different types of input and output.
These details are held in the registry and when you select an application,
a dialogue box specific to the application is displayed for you to enter
the required parameters. 
</p>

<h3>3.1 ADQL queries</h3>

<p>
If you selected an application that requires an ADQL query as input,
you will be taken to the  
<a href="http://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/s.dalla/astrogrid/documentation/QueryBuilder.html">Query Builder</a>.
</p>

<p>
The output of an ADQL query is a VOTable. By default this 
VOTable will be displayed in a Workbench window in a user-friendly
format, once the query has been executed.
If you would like the Votable to be saved into a file instead, click on
<tt>Parameter</tt>, then on the <tt> Ref?</tt> box to specify
a file location either on your local disk or in MySpace.
</p>


<h3>3.2 Cone Searches or SIAP</h3>

<p>
If you selected an application that queries for data using a Cone
Search or SIAP, you will be taken to a window
where you can specify input parameters. Double click on a
box to type in it. 
</p>

<p>
The output of a Cone Search or SIAP is a VOTable. By default this 
VOTable will be displayed in a Workbench window in a user-friendly
format, once the query has been executed.
If you would like the Votable to be saved into a file instead, click on
<tt>Parameter</tt>, then on the <tt> Ref?</tt> box to specify
a file location either on your local disk or in MySpace.
</p>

<h3>3.3 Tools</h3>

<p>
If you selected an application that runs a tool or model,
you will be taken to a window
where you can specify input parameters. Double click on a
box to type in it. 
If the input parameter you want to specify is a file,
click on the <tt> Ref?</tt> box and select the file (from your
Local Disk or from MySpace or from URL reference).
</p>

<p>
Again use the <tt> Ref?</tt> box to specify names for output files.
</p>

<h2>4. Executing the application</h2>

<p>
Click on the green 'Execute this application' icon to launch the application.
This will automatically open a  
<a href="http://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/s.dalla/astrogrid/documentation/Lookout.html">Lookout</a>
window, that allows you to monitor
progress of the application and display the results.
If you launched a query, this will be listed under <tt>Queries</tt>,
if you launched a tool, this will be listed under <tt>Tasks</tt>.
