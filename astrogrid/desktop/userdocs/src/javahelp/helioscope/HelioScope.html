<h1>HelioScope</h1>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>
HelioScope allows you to locate, visualise and download Heliospheric data
for a specified time range.
</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>
HelioScope is an AstroGrid tool that queries Heliospheric datasets for
data in the time range specified by the user. It is the Solar System
equivalent of the AstroScope tool developed for night time Astronomy 
datasets. 
</p>

<h2>Using HelioScope</h2>

<h3>Datasets available</h3>

<p>
In its initial release, HelioScope queries the Virtual Solar Observatory
(VSO) and the NASA CDAW service. Extension to more datasets is planned.
</p>


<h3>Searching for data</h3>

<p>
You can specify a start and end time for your HelioScope search
either by typing into the boxes (times must be in the format 
<tt>2005-07-31T01:00:00</tt>) or by clicking on the drop-down icon next
to the times and using the Calendar interface (click on a day in the
Calendar to select it, double-click on the hour or minute or second,
then use the arrows to change the times).
</p>

<p>
Click on <tt>Search</tt> to start the search. As data centers reply to
the HelioScope request, new nodes are added to the display window.
</p>

<p>
To visualise files returned from the search for a given dataset, 
single-click on the node
showing the dataset name. Child nodes display instrument information.
Each final node, displaying a time string, represents a single data file.
The time displayed in this node is the start time of the data in the file.
</p>

<p>
To go back to the initial view of the HelioScope results, click on 
<tt>Go to Top</tt>.
</p>

<p>
Moving the mouse over a bubble displays additional
information on the dataset or data file.
</p>

<p>
There are 3 possible way to visualise the results: the <tt>Radial</tt>
view (default), the <tt>Hyperbolic</tt> view, and the  <tt>Services</tt>
view. Click on the correspondong tab to select a view. The <tt>Services</tt>
view shows which datasets have been queried and how many files were found
for each service.

<h3>Selecting and downloading files</h3>

<p>
To select files for download, double-click on nodes. 
To select a single data file, double-click on the corresponding node.
The file will be highlighted in yellow.
Continue to double-click to add more files.
If you double-click
on a dataset name, all the child nodes (i.e. files)
for that dataset are selected.
If you double-click on <tt>Search Results</tt> all the files 
are selected (use with caution!).
</p>

<p>
To save the selected files, click on the <tt>Save</tt> icon. Here you will
be prompted for your AstroGrid login name and password.
Once you are logged in, you can specify where you want to save
the files. This may be either a directory on your local machine,
or a location in MySpace. In the new window that opens,
click on the directory name, and hit
Enter, then click on Save: the files will be saved.
</p>

<p>
To deselect a file, double-click on the corresponding node. To 
clear the entire selection click on <tt>Clear Selection</tt>.
