<h1>Solar Movie Maker Help</h1>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
This Astrogrid science service allows a user to make a movie of solar 
images by means of a simple interface. It is available via the Workbench.
</p>

<p>
Datasets are:  
</p>

<ul>
  <li>SOHO/EIT</li>
  <li>TRACE</li>
</ul>

<p>
Currently the movie maker takes as input an instrument name and a time 
interval for the movie.
</p>

<h2>How to run the Solar Movie Maker</h2> 

<p>
Launch the AstroGrid Workbench and  
click on <tt>Parameterised Workflows</tt>. You will be asked for your
Astrogrid login details, unless you are already logged in.
Choose the Solar Movie Maker. 
</p>

<p>
A new window will open: here you can specify the input parameters
(double-click on boxes under <tt>Value</tt> to type in): 
</p>

<h3>Input parameters</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Instrument name: either 'trace' or 'eit'</li>
  <li>Start date/time and end date/time (yyyy/mm/ddThh:mm:ss.000)</li>
</ul>

<center>
  <img src="MovieInput.gif" alt="Input dialog box"/>
</center>

<p>
Click on the green circular icon to execute. This launches the workflow. You will be asked 
if you want to save the workflow document - saving the document into 
MySpace will allow you to load the workflow in the Workflow Builder 
to view it / modify it.
</p>

<p>
The Lookout window opens: 
</p>

<center>
<p>
  <img src="Jobsmonitor.gif"  alt="Jobs Monitor Window"/>
</p>
</center>

<p>
Under <tt>Workflows</tt> you will see an entry for your movie workflow.
The entry will be green while the job is running and will become black
when it has completed. 
At this point go to the MySpace Browser in the Workbench: in
the directory called 'votable' you will find the output movie
that you can download to your local machine.
The name of 
the output movie will depend on your input parameters, e.g. for the ones 
in the screenshot above it will be: eit2002-07-28T01:00:00.000.mpg .
</p>

<h2>
Usage Notes:
</h2>

<ul>
  <li>     
  TRACE data are archived in hourly files (also called 'tri' files). At 
  present the movie maker produces TRACE movies of minimum duration 1 hour.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Main workflow steps</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
  Start and end time are written into a template query and the query is 
  sent to the data centre.
  </li>
  <li>
  Output of the query is sent to the AstroGrid SolarMovieMaker tool which 
  downloads the files to MySpace and runs a set of SolarSoft mapping software 
  routines that take the images and combine them into an mpeg movie.
  </li>
  <li>
  Output mpeg is sent to user's myspace.
  </li>
</ul>
