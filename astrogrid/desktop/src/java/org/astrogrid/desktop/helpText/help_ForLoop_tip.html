  The <b>for</b> element expresses a for loop.<br> 
  The structure of the for loop is similar to the for in Python (or for-each in Javascript)<br>
  - it iterates over a sequence, rather than using an arithmetic expression like in Java / C / C++.<br>
  The for element has two required attributes: <b>items</b> which must evaluate to a list of items to iterate over; <br>
  and <b>var</b> which provides the name of the loop variable to assign each element of the list to. <br>
  The <b>body</b> of the for element is an activity that will be executed for each item on the list.
