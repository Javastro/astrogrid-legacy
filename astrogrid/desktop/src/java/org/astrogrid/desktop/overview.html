<h1>Overview and Rough Design</h1>
<pre>
Prototype implementation of a desktop integration / launcher component.

Main features.
1) gui for login and configuration (browser based?) (maybe simpler to test).
2) webstart friendly.
3) service for interfacing from other components. - need to work out interface schemes.
4) launcher for other apps. (scripting console, treeview, etc).
5) single location for login and config.
6) rudimentary security for connecting to the services.
7) later - messaging endpoint. could present to the user as RSS?
could implement all this in html / servlet tech .. launching system browser from a simple gui status button...

so its a war file, containing servlets, etc, bundled up with jetty.


technology
need a servlet framework that will allow same  business logic (and state) to be called from a variety of inputs, and output
in a variety of ways (soap, xml, xmlrpc, html, text)

not very keen to use a heavy framework however.

so need a shared _model_, which is then made accessible via different kinds of view.

model should be quite task-oriented - and not as fine grained as astrogird-scripting.
model comprises a set of objects, one for each delegate/service
so - community, jes, cea, registry, myspace
plus a persistent configuration service.

each object has stateless operations (no getters / setters or state changers).
input to each operation must be simple types.. (string, DOM, int, etc).
Wonder what format to return results in - probably xml as basic, and then can
apply xslt to convert to html / text.

however, java-RMI, XML-RPC and SOAP need java types, not a document.
so should return simple types,
and then have separate passes to - 
- serialize to xml
- transform to text / html.

serialization - could use xstream? nice, simple xml.

wonder if I can structure the different ways of accessing the same model as servlet filters / request interceptors..
will check with jetty.

	<h1>further work</h1>
	<ul>
<li/>need to improve error handling - logging, recovery, transport back to user - error codes, method for xmlrpc.
<li/>add soap and java-rmi protocols. maybe hot-folders too?
<li/>add in true port and path obfuscation - and remove 'browse context' from jetty.
<li/>think about how to handle method overloading (allows us to pass in optional parameters)	
<li/> unit tests for internals, integration tests for services
<li/>implement remaining services.
<li/>client side - improve appearance, add launchers / application registry.
<li/>examine how other webstart apps can interface with the desktop (rmi? jnlp installer..) - 
so make desktop a forced install to use treeview, topcat, etc.
<li/>messaging, callback interface.
</ul>
