  The <b>for</b> element expresses a for loop.<br> The structure of the for loop is similar to the for in Python (or for-each in Javascript) - it iterates over a
  sequence, rather than using an arithmetic expression like in Java / C / C++.
  The for element has two required attributes: <b>items</b> which must evaluate to a list of items to iterate over;
  and <b>var</b> which provides the name of the loop variable to assign each element of the list to.
  The <b>body</b> of the for element is an activity (presently a sequence of activites) that will be executed for each item on the list.

  &lt;!-- count up to 10 --&gt; 
    &lt;for var="x" items="${1...10}&gt; &lt;!-- start ... finish is groovy syntax for numeric ranges --&gt;
      &lt;script&gt;
        &lt;body&gt;
          print(x);
        &lt;/body&gt;
      &lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;/for&gt;
