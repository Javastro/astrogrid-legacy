Python Astrogrid Scripts
========================

This folder contains a selection of simple python scripts, that show how to connect
to the astrogrid desktop server programatically. The same boilerplate is used at the
start of each script to parse in the connection settings file and create an xmlrpc client
(confusingly called a Server):

import xmlrpclib as x
import os
prefix = file(os.path.expanduser("~/.astrogrid-desktop")).next().rstrip()
s = x.Server(prefix + "xmlrpc")

The xmlrpc client can call all the methods exposed in the html server. It also provides
three additional methods.

s.system.listMethods()
        will produce a list of all available methods on the server

s.system.methodHelp(methodName)
        will produce documentation on a method

s.system.methodSignature(methodName)
        will display the types of the inputs and outputs of the method


Example:

>> print s.system.methodHelp('astrogrid.registry.resolveIdentifier')

Module astrogrid
        Astrogrid Components
Component registry
        Interrogate and browse the registry
Method resolveIdentifier
        Resolve a service ivorn to a web service
                                endpoint
ivorn : string
identifier of the service to resolve
unknown : string
url of endpoint
