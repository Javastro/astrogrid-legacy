lots of acr functions return void - is this always appropriate?

system_apihelp_callFunction is a nuisance - too loosely typed

astrogrid_applications_convertStructToDocument has argument named struc - C reserved word

parameter called long everywhere - C reserved word - lon better

plastic dealt with separately, so that the 

overloading in delete function of the VFS 

ivoa_siap_execute overrides the same function in the standard dal - this is a little strange- all that it amounst o is a change of documentation

better to make all floats double...

hasCoverage support is awkward - it is a double inheritance tricky...

org.astrogrid.acr.ivoa.resource.Date has to be renamed to org.astrogrid.acr.ivoa.resource.CurationDate in jel.xml before running script

is @bean abd @xmlrpc used consistently


Service_Base is the only non bottom level base style class that is used as a return value....
