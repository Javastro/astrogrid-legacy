	<section name="Astro Runtime : Client-Side Middleware for the VO"><p>
	The Astro Runtime (AR) simplifies access to all Virtual Observatory (VO) services.
	This component provides an API that is simple, consistent and self-contained
	 - making the VO more accessible.
</p>

<p>
			Some current or potential uses of the AR are
			<!--  check for concrete examples of these. -->
			<ul>
				<li>as  infrastructure for new VO clients and services.</li>
				<li>to VO-integrate existing desktop applications</li>
				<li>to provide VO functionality to existing packages (PyRaf, Parceltongue/AIPS) </li>
				<li> simplify science scripting: e.g. programmatic access to VO
					services from Python and IDL
				</li>
				<li>to provide a commandline interface to the VO</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
</section>
	<section name="Motivation">
		<p>
			Virtual Observatory technology is becoming complex -
			partly through necessity, and partly because of growing
			pains. This complexity is challenging and time-consuming to
			learn and may be a barrier to entry for some. Amongst the
			causes of the complexity are:
			<ul>
				<li>growing number of standards</li>
				<li>interaction between standards</li>
				<li>variation between standard versions</li>
				<li>non-compliance of service implementations</li>
				<li>
					use of existing computer-science technologies -
					WS-*, SOAP, XML Schema
				</li>
				<li>
					variation between implementations of these
					technologies
				</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			We hope that the Astro Runtime (AR) hides enough of this complexity
			so that the VO becomes accessible to more developers - from professional
			programmers to casual shell scripters.
