        <title>AstroGrid Client Runtime - Interface</title>
</properties>
<body>

<section name="Overview"><p>
This project defines a set of interfaces for calling into the AstroGrid Client Runtime (ACR). Some of the
interfaces expose internals of the runtime system, while others are used to access remote AstroGrid servers.
</p>
<p>
The set of interfaces form a <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?FacadePattern">Facade</a> infront of the more complex service delegates - 
this facade is in a single project and is self-contained - there's no dependencies on
other AstroGrid libraries or delegates; naming conventions, parameters and exception types are
consistent throughout the interface; and all the required documentation is in one place.
</p>
<p>
  These interfaces can be accessed directly by classes running within the ACR; they can be accessed 
  via JavaRMI by external Java code; and can be accessed via XMLRPC from other programming languages.
