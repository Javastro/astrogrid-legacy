Connection Recipes for languages other than Java.

(for Java, see java/examples/Connect.java)

Each subdirectory contains examples of using the ACR for a particular programming 
language.

Some of these have been contributed and are not actively tested - please let me
know if you encounter problems. Also, I'd appreciate recipes for other languages - 
Fortran, IDL, R, etc.
