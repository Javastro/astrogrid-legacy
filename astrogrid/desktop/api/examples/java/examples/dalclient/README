This folder contains the examples that come with Doug Tody's DALClient, transcribed
to use the equivalent AR functions.

They're handy utilities (if you find compiling java convenient), and also illustrate that
AR can do all that DALClient can - almost line-for-line equvalent.

Refer to the main example package for richer examples - integrating DAL with Registry,
name resolvers, Myspace, and PLASTIC.
