/** a general manager for the execution , monitoring, and control of all remote processes.

 * RemoteProcessManager unifies the  functionality in {@link org.astrogrid.acr.astrogrid.Jobs} and {@link org.astrogrid.acr.astrogrid.Applications}
 * and provides additional features - notably ability to register callbacks for progress notifications. It is still valid to use the <tt>Jobs</tt> or <tt>Applications</tt>, 
 * however, this interface also knows how to invoke other kinds of service, and provides a uniform interface to cea, cone, siap, ssap services.
