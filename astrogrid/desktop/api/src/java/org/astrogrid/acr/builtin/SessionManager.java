/** Service that creates new user sessions.
 * 
 * There's one default user session - this is the one who's connection 
 * properties are described in ~/.astrogrid-properties  (for XMLRPC & HTTP) 
 * and to which RMI clients connect to automatically using the Finder.
 * 
 * However, this service allows a client connected to the default user session to 
 * create a new session - which will not share state such as authentication,
 * login information, etc with the default session. This is useful in a multi-user 
 * or server-side settings.
 * 
 * Once a session has been created, call the {@link #findHttpSession(String)}, {@link #findXmlRpcSession(String)}
 * or {@link Finder#findSession(String)}
 * 
 * Note however, that this session manager does not make any strong guarantees about
 * security - the purpose of this feature is to enable multiple user identities within the same AR -
 * not to enforce strict isolation between users of the same AR. In particular, all 
 * clients of the AR must first use the default user session to create a new one, 
 * and it may also be possible to determine how to connect to other sessions - hence
 * it is recommended that all clients connecting to the AR are mutually trusting.
