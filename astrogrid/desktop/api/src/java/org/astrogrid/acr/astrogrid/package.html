<h1>Astrogrid Webservices</h1>

This module provides access to Astrogrid-Specific services. Many of 
these services are fore-runners of upcoming IVOA standards.

<h2>Remote File Storage</h2>
{@link org.astrogrid.acr.astrogrid.Myspace} is a prototype of the upcoming
IVOA VOSpace standard for distributed file systems.

<h2>Long-running Remote Applications and Queries</h2>

Astrogrid provides a framework for remote execution of
complex database queries and 
long-running processing applications (such as cross-matching codes). 
This powerful functionality takes a little more
effort to access than synchronous data services (such as provided by 
{@link org.astrogrid.acr.ivoa.Dal} services). It is split between two components
<dl>
<dt>{@link org.astrogrid.acr.astrogrid.Applications}</dt>
<dd>Handles selecting a remote application, and constructing an invocation</dd>
<dt>{@link org.astrogrid.acr.astrogrid.RemoteProcessManager}</dt>
<dd>Execute the application, manage the execution, and retreive the results</dd>
</dl>


<h2>Authentication</h2>
Sign-on and Authentication for Astrogrid services is provided by the
{@link org.astrogrid.acr.astrogrid.Community} component. 

<h2>Time-Series Data</h2>
The {@link org.astrogrid.acr.astrogrid.Stap} component provides access to 
Time-Series data from a range of astronomical and solar data providers.
