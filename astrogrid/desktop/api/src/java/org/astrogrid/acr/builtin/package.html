<h1>Builtin Module</h1>

Service Interfaces for components in the <tt>builtin</tt> module of the ACR - components that provide access into the 
deepest internals of the ACR
<p />
At present there's just the ACR itself, and Shutdown. Later, plan to add module-loading and management interfaces - so external modules & libraries
can be loaded into a running ACR.
<p />
This package also contains descriptor objects for the modules, components and methods that make up the ACR. These descrptions can be accessed 
from the system.apihelp component.
