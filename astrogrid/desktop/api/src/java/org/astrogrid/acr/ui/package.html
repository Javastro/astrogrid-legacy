<h1>User Interface Module</h1>
Interfaces to User Interface Components - which can either be used as mini-applications in their own right, or aggregated into other, possibly external, applications.

<p>
	Once a late-loading plugin system is in place, these components may well be factored out of the core ACR distribution, and
	be made available for optional download into the workbench.
