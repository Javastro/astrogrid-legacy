<h1>Find and connect to  the Astro Runtime daemon</h1>

Start by creating an instance of the  {@link org.astrogrid.acr.Finder} class. This takes care of locating a
running Astro Runtime service (possibly creating one if necessary) and returns an instance of {@link org.astrogrid.acr.builtin.ACR} that is
