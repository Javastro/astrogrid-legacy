        <name>Top Level Project for AR / Workbenchs</name>
        <description>
        Workbench and AR requires the astrogrid/maven-base projects to be checked out adjacent to this folder.
        (NB: previous versions also required the aggregate project - this is no longer necessary)

        BOOTSTRAPPING
        On a fresh download, you need to run a few goals to get things started - 
        otherwise event things like 'maven astrogrid-clean' will fail.
        -1. run % maven create-keystore
        0. run % maven install-materials

        You may wish to increase the memory maven runs with. create a '~/.mavenrc' which contains the line 
        	MAVEN_OPTS="-Xmx1024m"
        	
        This build requires Java 1.4 - it will fail under 1.5. You might need to do a 
        export JAVA_VERSION=1.4.2 to cause the correct version of java to be run

        PUBLISHING
		Publisher should just run the goals listed in this project - no need to run goals in individual sub-projects.
		E.g. to build and publish new suite of AR:
		1. % maven astrogrid-clean 
		2. Edit astrogrid.destop.version in ${basedir}/template/project.properties
		3. % maven astrogrid-build-artifact
		
		Build products are then left in ${basedir}/target/artifacts directory, from where they 
		(for now) have to be uploaded to the plone site by hand.
		---
		ECLIPSE
		To setup workbench for development in eclipse:
		run steps 1-2 above.
		3. % maven install-materials
		4. % cd impl; maven eclipse
		5. In Eclipse select 'File > Import > Existing Projects into Workspace', and navigate to the impl directory.
		This works best in Eclipse >= 3.2 and above.
		---
		If you need to edit the public api, repeast steps 5,6 for the 'api' directory
		---
		For for development instruction, run 
		% cd impl; maven -u
