	<p>  
                The Astrogrid Client runtime (ACR) is a desktop service which other client-side applications can connect with
                to interact with astrogrid. The ACR provides a high-level facade into AstroGrid services, accessible
		from HTTP / XML-RPC / JavaRmi and Gui interfaces.           
	</p>
	<p>
               The ACR provides a single sign-on, single-configuration, and single cache for interactions with astrogrid servers -
                making implementation of client-side applications simpler.
	</p>
		<p>
			The Workbench is a suite of client-side applications for accessing AstroGrid services - a registry browser,
			myspace manager, job controller and application invoker. It is layered upon the AstroGrid Client Runtime (ACR).
