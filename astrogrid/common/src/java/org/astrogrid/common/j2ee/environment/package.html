		<p>An environment editor for web applications.</p>
		
		<h3>Purpose</h3>
		<p>
			The configuration of an AstroGrid server-side component is set through
			its J2EE environment-entries, the values of which are made available 
			to the application via JNDI. In a correctly-written web-application,
			all the environment entries are declared (name, type, description)
			in the deployment descriptor (web.xml) and may have default values there.
			The servlet container running the web application is supposed to 
			supply controls by which the environment entries may be set.
		</p>
		<p>
			Jakarta-Tomcat, the preferred servlet container for AstroGrid components,
			has a poor UI for setting the environment entries. In the most-recent
			versions of Tomcat, this UI is not even present by default. Therefore,
			it is convenient for a web application to provide its own UI
			for setting environment entries.
		</p>
		<p>
			This package contains components for a UI that sets environment entries
			in its parent web-application. These components comply with J2EE
			restrictions and can be used with any J2EE-compliant servlet container.
			However, they are specifically intended for use with Tomcat.
		</p>
		
		<h3>Structure and usage</h3>
		<p>The environment-editing sub-system consists in:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Java beans ({@link org.astrogrid.common.j2ee.environment.Environment} annd
				{@link org.astrogrid.common.j2ee.environment.EnvEntry})
				representing the relevant content of <i>web.xml</i>;</li>
			<li>a servlet 
				({@link org.astrogrid.common.j2ee.environment.EnvironmentServlet})
				which parses <i>web.xml</i> and makes the results available as Java beans;</li>
			<li>JSPs that present the content of the Java beans.</li>
		</ul>
		<p></p>
		<p>
			An <i>EnvEntry</i> bean represents one environment entry. It holds the name, 
			description, type and default value from <i>web.xml</i>, the operational value from JNDI
			and a replacement value set be an editor JSP. See the bean class for more details.
		</p>
		<p>
			An <i>Environment</i> bean is
			a container for a collection of <i>EnvEntry</i> beans. It also has a property holding the
			context path of the web application; see the bean class for more details.
		</p>
		<p>
			The servlet should be set to load as the web application starts (see the section below
			for details). On loading, it parses <i>web.xml</i> and stores the results as a collection
			of <i>EnvEntry</i> beans inside a <i>Environment</i> bean. The <i>Environment</i> bean is
			added to the servlet context as an attribute of name <i>environment</i>.
		</p>
		<p>
			There should be three JSPs with an optional fourth.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li><i>admin/environment-main.jsp</i> is an index page with instructions and links to the
				other JSPs.</li>
			<li><i>admin/environment-edit.jsp</i> displays the environment entries in an HTML form.
			Submitting the form activates the <i>EnvironmentServlet</i> and updates the 
			<i>EnvEntry</i> beans.</li>
			<li><i>admin/environment-tomcat.jsp</i> writes out the environment as a context file for
			Tomcat. It uses the replacement values if they are set, otherwise the operational values.
			The output can be saved to file and inserted into Tomcat's configuration directory to
				reconfigure the running application.</li>
			<li><i>admin/environment-properties.jsp</i> works like 
				<i>admin/environment-tomcat.jsp</i> but writes out the values as a properties file.
			  This JSP isn't always needed in a Tomcat environment.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			There are ready-to-use versions of all four of these JSPs in the Maven project 
			<i>astrogrid/common</i>, in the 
			<i>src/webapp/admin</i> directory. These should be copied into the Maven project
			for the web application where they will be used. The JSPs can be used as provided or
			can be customized.
		</p>
		<p>
			A JSP that needs to display the environment entries loads the <i>Environment</i>
			bean thus:
		</p>
		<pre>
&lt;jsp:useBean class="org.astrogrid.common.j2ee.environment.Environment" 
		 id="environment" scope="application"/&gt;
		</pre>
		<p>
			This loads the bean that was set up by the <i>EnvironmentServlet</i> when the web application
			started. The JSP then iterates through the <i>EnvEntry</i> beans thus:
		</p>
		<pre>
&lt;%
org.astrogrid.common.j2ee.environment.EnvEntry[] entries = environment.getEnvEntry();
pageContext.setAttribute("entries", entries);
%&gt;
&lt;c:forEach var="e" items="${entries}"&gt;
	...
&lt;/c:forEach&gt;
		</pre>
		<p>
			where the <i>c</i> prefix in the tags implies the core part of the Java standard tag library.
			(An alternative to using JSTL is to use "scriptlets" to iterate and process the beans.
			JSTL is neater.)
		</p>
		<p>
			A JSP that wants to update the replacement values of the <i>EnvEntry</i> beans sends an
			HTTP request (either get or post method) to the <i>EnvironmentServlet</i>, setting the request 
			parameters as follows.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Each parameter is the replacement value for one <i>EnvEntry</i> bean.</li>
			<li>The name of each parameter matches the name property of the bean whose value it sets.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Any other parameters are ignored. 
		</p>
		
		
		<h3>Adding this package to a web application</h3>
		
		<h4>Make the classes available</h4>
		<p>You must make sure that you web application has, in <i>WEB-INF/lib</i>,
		the AstroGrid jar including <i>org.astrogrid.common.j2ee.environment</i>.
			The Maven dependency code for this is as follows.</p>
		<pre>
&lt;dependency&gt;
  &lt;groupId&gt;org.astrogrid&lt;/groupId&gt;
	&lt;type&gt;jar&lt;/type&gt;
	&lt;artifactId&gt;astrogrid-common&lt;/artifactId&gt;
	&lt;version&gt;&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
		</pre>
		<p>and you will have to set the version yourself.</p>

	  <h4>Configure the servlet</h4>
		<p>Edit <i>web.xml</i> to configure the servlet:</p>
		<pre>
&lt;servlet&gt;
	&lt;servlet-name&gt;EnvironmentServlet&lt;/servlet-name&gt;
	&lt;display-name&gt;Environment control servlet&lt;/display-name&gt;
	&lt;servlet-class&gt;org.astrogrid.common.j2ee.environment.EnvironmentServlet&lt;/servlet-class&gt;
	&lt;load-on-startup&gt;1&lt;/load-on-startup&gt;
&lt;/servlet&gt;
			
&lt;servlet-mapping&gt;
	&lt;servlet-name&gt;EnvironmentServlet&lt;/servlet-name&gt;
	&lt;url-pattern&gt;/admin/EnvironmentServlet&lt;/url-pattern&gt;
&lt;/servlet-mapping&gt;
		</pre>
    <p>
	    You will need to split this block of code to put the <i>servlet</i> and
    	<i>servlet-mapping</i> elements in their proper places in <i>web.xml</i>.
    	(The schema for <i>web.xml</i> prescribes the order of elements; all
    	<i>servlet</i> elements must come before the first <i>servlet-mapping</i>
    	so you can't put the mappings after the servlets to which they refer.)
    </p>
		<p>
			The <i>load-on-startup</i> element causes the servlet to be loaded and initialized
			before it is first called by the JSPs. This is important; the displays will be
			wrong if this part is left out.
		</p>
		<p>
			You can change the details of the declaration if you wish. E.g., you may wish
			to change the <i>url-mapping</i> in order to use a different URL path for this
			sub-system. If you do make changes, then you will useually have to change the JSPs
			to suit.
		</p>
		
		<h4>Add the JSPs</h4>
		<p>
			Copy the JSPs from the <i>src/webapp/admin</i> branch of the  
			<i>astrogrid-common</i> Maven-project. Put them in the 
			<i>src/webapp/admin</i> branch of the Maven project for your
			own application, such that they go into CVS and appear in the <i>admin</i>
			subdirectory of the web-application when it is deployed.
			The JSPs need to be in this sub-directory in order to connect with
			the environment servlet.
		</p>
		<p>
			You are encouraged to customize the JSPs to suit your web application.
			The JSP code in <i>astrogrid-common</i> should be used as examples for
			creating your own JSPs which you keep CVS with your web-application code.
		</p>
		
		<h4>Add jars for the Java standard tag library</h4>
		<p>
			The example JSPs use the Java standard tag library and you will need to provide
			classes that implement this (unless your servlet container provides them). 
		</p>
