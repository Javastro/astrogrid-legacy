Configuration package; provides a simple set of methods for application-wide
access to properties, using both traditional key/value pairs and XPath querying.
<p>
<h3>Background</h3>
The configuration package has to provide the following:<p>
<li>Simple, backwardly compatible access to simple key/value properties
<li>Ability to load from several files (eg user-entered values, plus programmer-entered values)
<li>Provide a getproperty(XPath) returning XML nodes (implies a load from XML)
<p>

<h3>Simple</h3>
For the most simplest of configurations, use the static methods on the SimpleConfig class.
These access a single (hidden) instance, and allows programmers to use the
configuration with a minimum of code.

<h3>Instance</h3>
Create using a factory if this is really your thing :-)

<h3>Loading</h3>
You can request a load from urls, files, and the autoload will look in JNDI and
the system environment for urls, and the local directory for a default filename.
You can load from as many files as you like for the PropertyConfig; only the latest
will work at the moment for the XML version.

<h3>Accessing XML</h3>
XPath doesn't seem to have settled yet, so be prepared for this one to break
occasionally.
