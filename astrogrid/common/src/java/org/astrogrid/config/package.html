Configuration package; provides a simple set of methods for application-wide
access to properties, using both traditional key/value pairs and XPath querying.
<p>
<h3>Background</h3>
The configuration package has to be able to:<p>
<li>Provide simple, backward-compatible access to key/value properties
<li>Run without any configuration file present, with values set by the code, for unit tests
<li>Load from several files (eg user-entered values, plus programmer-entered values)
<li>Provide a getproperty(XPath) returning XML nodes (implies a load from XML) for structured properties
<p>

<h3>Simple</h3>
For the most simplest of configurations, use the static methods on the SimpleConfig class.
These access a single (hidden) instance, and allows programmers to use the
configuration with a minimum of code, like this:
<p>
<b>Initialisation:</b>
<pre><code>
SimpleConfig.autoload();
</pre></code>
or
<pre><code>
SimpleConfig.load("SomeFile.cfg");
</pre></code>
<b>Using Properties:</b>
<pre><code>
String fruit = SimpleConfig.getProperty("GlobalFruit");
</pre></code>

<h3>Instance</h3>
Create using the provided factory if this is really your thing :-)  If you provide
the factory method with a key object, you can reget the same one. For example:
<pre><code>
PropertyConfig config = ConfigFactory.getPropertyConfig("REGISTRY");
</pre></code>
returns the same instance as another same call elsewhere in the code:
<pre><code>
ConfigFactory.getPropertyConfig("REGISTRY");
</pre></code>

<h3>Loading</h3>
You can request a load from urls or files.  The autoload() method will look in JNDI and
the system environment for urls, and the local directory for a default filename.
You can load from as many files as you like for the PropertyConfig; only the latest
will work at the moment for the XML version.

<h3>Accessing XML</h3>
XPath doesn't seem to have settled yet, so be prepared for this one to break
occasionally.  In the meantime, it takes the name of an element and does a search
for all nodes matching that element name.
