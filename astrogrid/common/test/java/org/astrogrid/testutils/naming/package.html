Very rough and ready naming service.

The JES uses the naming service built into Axis to locate the database.  This package contains a
rough and ready simple naming service to plug in instead.  It's of limited use - if you try to 
call a method that I haven't needed myself you'll probably get an UnsupportedOperationException, 
which is fair enough really.
<p>
See {@link  org.astrogrid.jes.testutils.naming.NamingServiceDemo NamingServiceDemo} if you want to know how to use it.
