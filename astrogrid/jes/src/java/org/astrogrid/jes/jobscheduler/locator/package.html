		<h1>Locator implementations</h1>
		Locators find information about a tool from somewhere - at the moment, they just resolve a symbolic tool name into 
		a service endpoint.
	<h2>Implementations</h2>
	The ideal implementation is one that queries an astrogrid registry - {@link org.astrogrid.jes.jobscheduler.locator.RegistryToolLocator}.
	While the registry is being developed, and for testing purposes, there are locator implementations that will resolve all tool names to 
	a fixed service endpoint - {@link org.astrogrid.jes.jobscheduler.locator.ConstantToolLocator} - and that will load resolution information from a
	configuration file - {@link org.astrogrid.jes.jobscheduler.locator.XMLFileLocator}, {@link org.astrogrid.jes.jobscheduler.locator.MapLocator}
