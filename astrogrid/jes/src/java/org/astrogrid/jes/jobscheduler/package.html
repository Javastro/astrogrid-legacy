		<h1>Job Scheduler Component</h1>
		A Job Scheduler is responsible for executing a collection of jobs, each composed of steps.
		<h2>Interface</h2>
			The {@link org.astrogrid.jes.jobscheduler.JobScheduler} interface defines the two methods
			that a job scheduler implementation should provide - a method to register a new job with the scheduler, and
			a method to notify the scheduler when a job step has completed.
			
	 <h2>Implementation</h2>
	 An implementation of a job scheduler can be broken down into the scheduler engine itself, and some helper components:
	 <ul>
	 	{@link org.astrogrid.jes.jobscheduler.Dispatcher} - interface into a step dispactcher, that executes a job step by calling a remote service.
	 	{@link org.astrogrid.jes.jobscheduler.Locator} - interface into a tool locator, which resolves tool names to service endpoints
	 	{@link org.astrogrid.jes.Jobscheduler.Policy} - interface into a scheduling policy, which determines the execution order of steps in the job.
	 </ul>
