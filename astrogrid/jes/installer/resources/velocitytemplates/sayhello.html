<h1>AstroGrid Job Entry System Installer</h1>
Version @VERSION@.   Built @NOW@.
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<br>
This software will download and install the AstroGrid Job Entry System component.<br>
For information on this and other AstroGrid components see the
software site <a href="http://software.astrogrid.org">http://software.astrogrid.org</a>.
<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<ol>
  <li>A connection to the Internet</li>
  <li>A target machine running Tomcat 5.0 or higher, with the Manager
webapp enabled</li>
  <li>Username and password for the Manager webapp</li>
  <li>An AstroGrid Registry (for
example: <tt>http://hydra.star.le.ac.uk:8080/astrogrid-registry</tt>
)</li>
  <li>Java jdk 1.4 (probably present if you are reading this!)</li>
</ol>
<h2>Installation</h2>
This installer will guide you through the installation process, downloading any necessary software and
prompting you for configuration options.  If you have previously installed JES, you can use the installer
to remove this instance or reinstall it.  During installation you will be prompted for a location JES can use as its working 
directory - this must be writable by Tomcat (and JES given permission under any security manager you may be running).
<br>
<h2>Listeners, proxies and URLS - important</h2>
When you enter the URL of your local Tomcat ensure that you use the full external URL of the machine, ie not 127.0.0.1.
This is important as it is used to construct the URLs of the JES listeners that are set in the webapp's JNDI properties.
<BR/>
Note - you can override the values of these listeners by setting the properties<br>
jes.monitor.endpoint.url and <br>
jes.results.endpoint.url<br>
in your properties input file.  These will take precedence over any urls calculated by
the installer.  This is particularly useful if you are using a proxying service.
