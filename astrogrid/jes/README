JES - Job Entry System

1.0 JES Configuration:
*****************************

1.1 The JES Configuration File and associated files
-------------------------------------------------------
The JES configuration file is named ASTROGRID_jesconfig.xml.
There are some files associated with it, one containing application
messages, and others used as templates for xml by the JES system.
All apart from the configuration file are automatically copied to 
a suitable classpath location. The configuration file requires
editing, and possibly merging with a previous config file if this is
not a first install.

1.2 Editing the config file.
-------------------------------
The config file is broken down into certain categories:
GENERAL       do not edit
MESSAGES      do not edit
JES           editable
MONITOR       editable
CONTROLLER    editable
SCHEDULER     editable
JOB           editable with caution
MESSAGELOG    do not edit - for future use
REGISTRY      do not edit - for future use
TOOLS         editable

1.2.1 JES Category
----------------------
Edit the ID value to uniquely name this JES installation. This value is used extensively
so choose a sensible value and stick with it.

1.2.2 MONITOR Category
-------------------------
Do not change the parser validation value from "false".
The url value identifies the job monitor web service. This must be set accurately to the
web service end point...
http://$HOST_DNS_NAME:8080/$JES/services/JobMonitorService 
Alter $HOST_DNS_NAME and $JES to reflect the deployed service for your installation.

1.2.3 CONTROLLER Category
------------------------------
Do not change the parser validation value from "false".
The url value identifies the job controller web service. This must be set accurately to the
web service end point...
http://$HOST_DNS_NAME:8080/$JES/services/JobControllerService 
Alter $HOST_DNS_NAME and $JES to reflect the deployed service for your installation.

1.2.4 SCHEDULER Category
------------------------------
Do not change the parser validation value from "false".
The url value identifies the job scheduler web service. This must be set accurately to the
web service end point...
http://$HOST_DNS_NAME:8080/$JES/services/JobSchedulerService 
Alter $HOST_DNS_NAME and $JES to reflect the deployed service for your installation

1.2.5 JOB Category
------------------------------
Only change these settings in consultation with your database administrator.
It should not be necessary to change these settings unless the Astrogrid naming
conventions infringe upon your own installation naming conventions. At present
the DATASOURCE and TABLENAME parameters are the only candidates for change.

1.2.4 TOOLS Category
------------------------------
This category is a short-term measure only. It is required to alter this only to 
locate a tool endpoint until we are mature enough to dynamically locate these.
For example...
LOCATION.QueryTool" value="http://$TOOL_HOST_DNS_NAME:8080/$TOOL/services/$SERVICE_NAME" />
$TOOL_HOST_DNS_NAME reflects the host where the tool is deployed
$TOOL completes the service path
$SERVICE_NAME name under which the ApplicationController for this service is deployed.
These details will probably change in the next two weeks (JL - 17/12/2003)

1.3 Locate the Config File.
-----------------------------
The config file needs to be located on the JES application class path. Copy it 
into the $CATALINA_HOME/webapps/$JES_HOME/WEB-INF/classes directory, where...
$CATALINA_HOME is the Tomcat install directory
$JES_HOME is the jes application install directory
