AstroGrid JES (Job Entry System) README.

Two important software prerequisites are JES's two properties files:

(1) The configuration file ASTROGRID_jesconfig.properties. A great deal
of setup-configurable data is held here. The file is well commented and bears
reading.

(2) The datacenter's messages file ASTROGRID_jesmessages.properties.
All messages issued by JES are detailed here. The file name is 
configurable within the ASTROGRID_jesconfig file.

The jes package will not work without these files being available within
Tomcat. BEWARE: we have had some difficulty with Tomcat picking up properties
files.

DATABASES.

JES requires one database:

A Job database to keep track of jobs entered into the AstroGrid system.
This is a small database of 6 tables. The ddl is available in the dbscripts
directory. All tables are accessed with write capability. Some details are
configurable within the ASTROGRID_jesconfig file.

At the present state of play, we have only had the opportunity of testing
using Sybase on the hydra machine.
