<section name="Uninstallation"><p>
To uninstall the jes service, use the adminstration console for your servlet container (e.g. the tomcat manager) to undeploy and delete the web application.
</p>
<p>
This will remove the web application, but will leave the working-directory intact. It is suggested that the working directory is then archived before being deleted by hand.
