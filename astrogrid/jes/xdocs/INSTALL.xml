<section name="CAUTION"><p>
The following is well out of date. Take with a pinch of salt until it is re-written
</p>

<section name="Prerequisites">

<subsection name="Externals"><p>

These are the environments under which JES was developed:
<ul>
<li>Java sdk j2sdk1.4.1_02</li>
<li>Tomcat 4.1.24</li>
<li>Axis-1_1</li>
</ul>
</p>
</subsection>

<subsection name="The Jes War file"><p>

Contains all the runtime files required for JES apart from the external prerequisites.
</p></subsection>

</section>

<section name="Deploying the War file"><p>

Tomcat must be installed and running in order to achieve this step.
Copy the jes war file into the Tomcat webapps directory. Tomcat will automatically
deploy the war file, creating the following directory structure under the webapps directory...
</p>
<p>
At the same time, the JES web services will be deployed automatically.

<section name="3.0 The JES Database"><p>

A Job database is required to keep track of jobs entered into the AstroGrid system.
MySQL or a similar relational database is required.
</p>
</section>
<section name="JNDI"><p>

For reference see:
<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/tomcat-4.1-doc/jndi-datasource-examples-howto.html">here</a>
</p><p>
JES uses JNDI to lookup it's associated database. One file requires
altering to enable this to happen:

The Tomcat SERVER.XML file - $CATALINA_HOME/conf/server.xml

<section name="Shutdown and restart Tomcat"><p>
JES should be ready to run.
