section name="Self Testing"><p>
Once the JES webapplication is installed, navigate to the root page of the webapplication, and run the links in the 'Installation Checks' section to verify that the JES server is configured correctly.
</p>

<subsection name="Automated Testing">
<p>First click on the link 'Axis Check'- this should provide a detailed page about the configuration of the webservice libraries. No errors should be reported, although one or two warnings may be expected.
</p>

<p>Secondly click the 'Installation Tests' link. This runs a batch of tests internal to the JES server. The results page should show green ticks next to each test - a cross indicates a failure, which usually means something is misconfigured.
</p>
</subsection>
<subsection name="Diagnostics">
<p>The 'Fingerprint' link generates a transcript of the components and configuration running within the JES server. Please attach this to any bug reports or queries - it makes tracking down problems easier. The transcript may also give you some indication of any configuration problems.
</p>

<p>The 'View web services' link will list the SOAP webservices in the JES Server. The following should be present -  ResultListener, JobControllerService, JobMonitorService. Clicking on one of the links should provide the wsdl for this webservice.
</p>
</subsection>
<subsection name="Manual Testing"><p>
The 'Html Jes Interface' link displays a simple HTML form which can be used to submit jobs, view a list of jobs by user, and retreive a particular job. This should be sufficient to manually test the system.
