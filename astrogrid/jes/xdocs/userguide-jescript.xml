    <section name="Result Var">
      <p>added an attributed &#39;result-var&#39; to the 
      <code>&lt;step&gt;</code>

      element - when set, it names a scripting variable in which to
      store a map of the results of the cea call. so now possible
      to set up workflow variables, manipulate via script elements,
      pass in as parameter to cea calls, define new variables from
      results of cea calls.</p>
    </section>

    <section name="System Objects">
      <p>a binding to an instance of the Astrogrid class into the
      JEScript environment. This means that methods on the
      Astrogrid scripting object can be called from 
      <code>&lt;script&gt;</code>

      steps in workflows.</p>

      <p>Whats the point? Now its possible to write workflow
      documents that contain script steps that do useful things
      like 
      <ul>
        <li>copy / move / delete files in vospace.</li>

        <li>read contents of a vospace file into a workflow
        scripting variable</li>

        <li>write contents of a vospace file</li>

        <li>query registry</li>
      </ul>

      and mindboggling / daft things like 
      <ul>
        <li>create and submit child-workflow documents</li>

        <li>cancel or delete their own workflow.</li>
      </ul>
      </p>
