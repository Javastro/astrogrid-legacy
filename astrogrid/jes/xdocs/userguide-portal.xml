    <section name="The Portal">
      <p>Managing a workflow and managing jobs are the two aspects
      of the portal directly involved in workflow. Functions that
      can be undertaken when managing a workflow: 
      <ul>
        <li>Creating a workflow</li>

        <li>Saving a workflow</li>

        <li>Inserting flows, sequences, control constructs, scripts
        and steps</li>

        <li>Inserting a tool into a step</li>

        <li>Assigning input and output parameters to a tool</li>

        <li>Assigning a join condition to a step</li>

        <li>Submitting a workflow to JES</li>
      </ul>

      Functions that can be undertaken when managing a job: 
	  <ul>
      <li>Browse list of jobs</li>

      <li>Examine one job for its current status (running,
      completed, in error)</li>

      <li>Examine each step within a job for its current status and
      any message associated with the step.</li>

      <li>Cancel a job.</li>

      <li>Delete a job.</li>
	</ul>
      A third area of the portal has important workflow
      implications: designing a query that can be run against a
      datacenter by including it within a workflow step. A fourth
      important area is the ability to browse files held within
      MySpace.</p>
