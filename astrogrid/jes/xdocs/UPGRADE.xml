To upgrade a jes server, uninstall the old webapplication, and install the new version. Ensure that the new version is configured to use the same working directory as the old webapplication.

<p>
It'd be prudent to take a backup copy of the working directory before doing this. Taking a note of the current configuration (e.g. saving a copy of the 'fingerprint' page) will assist when configuring the new webapplication.
