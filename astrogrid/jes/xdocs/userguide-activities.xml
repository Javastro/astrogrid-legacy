    <section name="Looping and Conditionals">
      <p>Implemented &#39;if&#39; statement - executes either a
      &#39;then&#39; branch, or optional &#39;else&#39; branch,
      based on truth value of &#39;test&#39; attribute - which can
      be a groovy expression.</p>

      <p>Implemented &#39;while&#39; loop - executes body based on
      truth value of &#39;test&#39; attribute.</p>

      <p>Impleented &#39;for&#39; loop - executes body for each
      item in a list - so like python &amp; jelly for - sometimes
      called forEach.</p>
    </section>

    <section name="Parallel Loop">
      <p>Implemented and unit tested parallel-for-loop. This is
      similar to the for-loop (executes loop body for each item in
      a list), but in this case the loop bodies are executed
      potentially in parallel. That is, any calls to CEA
      applications will be fired off concurrently - other workflow
      activites are processed sequentially by the jes server.</p>

      <p>A bit of a tricky one to implement - especially the
      treatment of variables and scopes - as there&#39;s many
      different values for the loop variable, all valid at the same
      time. Implememtation works by evaluating the list, and then
      uses the set of rules for the loop body as a template, from
      which new rules are generated for each loop branch. These
      rules are added to the rulestore, and then executed.</p>
