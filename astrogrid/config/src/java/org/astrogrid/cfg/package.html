[NB this package in the PAL project is a development of the one that was in common.  It's here to
avoid causing problems with dependent code, because the way we do our dependencies makes it easier
to copy something like this elsewhere, grumble grumble grumble]

Configuration package; provides a simple set of methods for application-wide
access to properties, using both traditional key/value pairs and XPath querying.
<p>
<h3>Background</h3>
The configuration package has to be able to:<p>
<li>Provide simple, backward-compatible access to key/value properties
<li>Run without any configuration file present, with values set by the code, for unit tests
<li>Load from several files (eg user-entered values, plus programmer-entered values)
<li>Provide a getproperty(XPath) returning XML nodes (implies a load from XML) for structured properties
<p>

<h3>Simple</h3>
For the most simplest of configurations, use the 'common' config provided by
the ConfigFactory, which is a singleton instance:
<p>
<b>Using Properties:</b>
<pre><code>
String fruit = ConfigFactory.getCommonConfig().getString("GlobalFruit");
</pre></code>

<h3>Implementation</h3>
The ConfigFactory returns FailbackConfig instances - see the class doc for how it
works.
