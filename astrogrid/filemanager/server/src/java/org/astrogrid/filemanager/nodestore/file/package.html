<h1>Transactional File-based implementation of node storage</h1>
Implemented using <a href="http://xstream.codehaus.org/">XStream</a> to serialize node metadata into xml documents, 
which are then stored in the transactional filestore provided by <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/transaction/">commons-transactions</a>
<p>
	Package contains classes to customize the xstream serialization, and implementations of NodeStore on top of the transactional filestore.
