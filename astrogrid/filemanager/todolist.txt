LATER:

- synch my wsdl with guy's - take guy's namespace, keep my changes.
FEATURES:

- pass attributes through to filestore - e.g. mimetype override. 
	- requires method for editng attributes on the client.
- get mimetype detection working in filestore - do I need to pass filename to the store to let it guess?
- bulk delete (i.e. delete folder & contents).
	- dangerous.
	- implement TrashCan idea - move deleted files to trashcan (storing original location as an attribute). Items remain in trashcan for a long,
	but not indefinate period - just enough time for user to go 'crap!!' and undo a delete.
		- requires an undo method too.

TESTS
- tests for bunching.
- check caching behaviour is correct.
- repeat tests for mock / in-memory components.s
