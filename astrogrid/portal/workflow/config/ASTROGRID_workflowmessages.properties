#
# Messages issued by the workflow components.
#
# Format of the message key: AGWKFEnnnnn
# AG       AstroGrid
# WKF      WorKFlow
# E/W/I/Z  E = error,  W = warning  I = information  Z = error messages with text hard coded in program
# nnnnn    unique message number (in effect this can be of any length, but see notes below)
#
# Format of the message body:
# <workflow-component-name>: <rest-of-message>
# See documentation for java.text.MessageFormat class for inserts into messages (e.g. {0})
#
# Note. Messages in the range 00001-99999 are reserved to development by org.astrogrid
# Users are free to use message numbers above this range (See below for guidance).
#
# Note. Z style messages (e.g. AGWKFZ00001) are included here for documentary purposes only.
# Z style messages are invariably system errors associated with configuration files or messages.
#
# Note. User-written routines or modules that generate their own messages must follow additional
# constrains. Please follow the above protocols, plus:
# (1) Use only message numbers in the range 100000 or above.
# (2) Attach a unique acronym to the message key that will help distinguish the message 
#     from other potential user-generated messages ON A GLOBAL BASIS!
# (3) Ensure user messages are placed at the end of the file. 
# (4) Please clearly document the message, or make sure its intent is obvious from the
#     message content. 
#
# For example:
# AGWKFE100023@leicester:{0}: Sort step failure due to insufficient memory.\
# Contact your system administrator. Recommendations: increase memory \
# or make available additional scratch disk space.
