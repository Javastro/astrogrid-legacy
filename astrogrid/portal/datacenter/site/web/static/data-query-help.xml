    The Data Query Builder accepts ADQL input in XML form which should be typed in to the text box.  To use this ADQL
    later in a job step, save the ADQL to MySpace using the 'Save' button.  To load an existing ADQL document, use the 'Load'
    button.
    
    <p/>
    
    The 'Test' button is in place that you might run your ADQL against a pre-defined DataCenter.  You should not use this
    functionality to run queries.  Please use your ADQL as part of a job step.
