    | This is the 'heart' of Cocoon. The sitemap maps URI space to 
    | resources. It consists basicaly of two parts: components and
    | pipelines. Pipelines are made out of components. There is such a
    | vast number of components available that it would be impossible to
    | describe them here, please refer to the accompanying
    | documentation. For specific components, have a look also at the
    | javadocs for them. Most pipelines are present to demonstrate some
    | feature or technique, often they are explained in more detail in 
    | the accompanying documentation. The sitemaps which come with each
    | sample and each block will help to explain.

<!-- =========================== Components ================================ -->

  <map:components>

  <!--+
      | All pipelines consist at least of two components: a generator, that
      | produces the content, and a serialiser, that delivers the content to
      | the client.
      | 
      | More precisely: a generator generates SAX events and a serializer
      | consumes these events and produces a byte stream.
      | 
      | Some things to note here: each generator has a unique name, this
      | name is mapped to a java class, one name is declared as the default
      | generator. Each generator may have additional configurations as
      | child elements.
      | 
      | Additional attributes are targeted at the component manager. The optional
      | "label" attribute is relevant for the view concept below. The optional
      | "logger" attribute defines the logging category where messages produced
      | by a component should go. If there's no "logger" attribute, the category
      | used is the one defined for the "sitemap" component in cocoon.xconf.
      | 
      | We have chosen in this sitemap to use a different logging category
      | for each component, which allows fine-grained classification of log
      | messages. But you are free to use any category you want.
      | 
      | It is possible to have the same java class declared as different
      | generators by using different names. No configuration options are
      | shared between these instances, however.
      | 
      | All components follow this scheme.
      +-->
    <map:generators default="file"/>

  <!--+
      | Transformers can be placed inside the pipeline between the generator
      | and the serializer. You may have as many transformers as you
      | like. Transformers consume SAX events and emit SAX events.
      |
      | The "xslt" transformer is an example of a component with additional
      | configuration.
      +-->
    <map:transformers default="xslt"/>

  <!--+
      | Serializers consume SAX events and produce a character stream. Every
      | pipeline needs to be terminated by a serializer.
      +-->
    <map:serializers default="html"/>

  <!--+
      | Readers circumvent the XML oriented SAX pipeline model, think of a reader
      | being a generator and a serializer at once thus a pipeline may not
      | contain any generator, transformer or serializer in addition to a
      | reader. They are useful for delivering binary content like images.
      +-->
    <map:readers default="resource"/>

  <!--+
      | Matchers are executed during pipeline setup. They decide if a
      | pipeline fragment is used within a pipeline. Usually, the decision
      | is based on a match on the requested URI but matchers exist, that
      | match different things as well. Most often the fragment contained in
      | a matcher has a generator as well as a serializer. This is not a
      | necessity, matchers can be nested while chaining does not work.
      +-->
    <map:matchers default="wildcard"/>

  <!--+
      | Selectors are executed during pipeline setup. They can be used to
      | determine which pipeline fragments should be combined. They are best
      | compared with a java switch statement.
      +-->
    <map:selectors default="browser"/>

  <!--+
      | Actions are executed during pipeline setup. Their purpose is to
      | execute some code that doesn't involve touching the stream of
      | pipeline events. Example usage is to update databases, check external 
      | resources, etc.. The execution may fail or complete successfully. Only 
      | if the execution of the action was successful, the pipeline fragment 
      | nested inside the action element is executed, otherwise, it's skipped
      | entirely and execution proceeds from the element right below the action.

      | The different pipe implementations
      | 
      | NON-CACHING:
      |   The non caching implementation of cocoon pipelines.
      | 
      | CACHING:
      |   Traditional longest cacheable key caching.
      | 
      | CACHING-POINT:
      |   The caching-point pipeline implements an extended             
      |   caching algorithm which is of particular benefit for use with 
      |   those pipelines that utilise cocoon-views and/or provide      
      |   drill-down functionality.                                     
      | 
      | The autoCachingPoint algorithim (if enabled) will automatically
      | cache common elements of the pipeline currently being processed - as well
      | as the entire cacheable pipeline according to the "longest cacheable key"
      | algorithm.
      | 
      | Consider the following simple pipeline, where generator G is labelled with
      | a cocoon-view enabling the pipeline to serialize data to either html or pdf 
      | depending on the value of cocoon-view (as provided by the request):
      | G - T -  S(html)
      | |__ T -  S(pdf)
      | 
      | If cocoon-view=html, then the caching-point algorithm will not only cache 
      | the longest cacheable path, which would be GTS(html) but also the
      | *common element* which in this case would be the results from G. If the
      | next request to this pipeline was cocoon-view=pdf, then there would be no
      | need to invoke the generator a second time, as it's value has already been
      | cached (provided G generates the same cache key)
      | 
      | Also note: One can switch "Off" autoCachingPoint and use "pipeline-hints" to
      | manually indicate that certain pipeline-components should be considered as
      | cache points.

<!-- =========================== Views =================================== -->

  <!--+
      | Views provide different, well, views to resources. Views are
      | orthogonal to pipelines. Please refer to the docs.
      |
      | It would be wise to disable any unneeded views in a 
      | production environment in order to avoid exposing data
      | that you may not necessarily wish to.
      +-->
  <map:views></map:views>

<!-- =========================== Resources ================================= -->

  <!--+
      | Resources are pipeline fragments that may be used from different
      | pipeline fragments. For our needs, they behave exactly like
      | pipelines, only that they are not accessible from outside.
      | Hence I will explain what's inside below for pipelines.

  <map:resources>
    <map:resource name="test-results">
      <map:generate type="request">
        <map:parameter name="generate-attributes" value="true"/>
      </map:generate>
      
      <map:transform src="cocoon:/test-results.xsl"/>
  
      <map:serialize type="xml"/>
    </map:resource>


  </map:resources>

<!-- ========================== Action sets ================================ -->

 <!--+
     | Action sets group actions together. If some actions are often used
     | together in pipeline fragments, it's easier to group them and refer
     | to the group. For more info, please see the docs.
     +-->
  <map:action-sets></map:action-sets>

<!-- =========================== Pipelines ================================= -->

 <!--+
     | Pipelines. The beef. Pipelines specify how the processing of your
     | content is done. Usually, a pipeline consists of several fragments
     | that specify the generation, transformation, and serialization of
     | SAX events.
     |
     | Processing is done in two steps:
     |
     | 1) The top level elements are executed in order of appearance until
     |    one signals success. These top level elements are usually
     |    matchers.
     |
     |    Other components are called depth-first to determine what
     |    fragments make up the processing pipeline. When a component
     |    fails, no nested components are called but the next component on
     |    the same level.
     |
     | 2) Once it is determined which generator, which transformers and
     |    wich serializer is used, these components are executed. During
     |    this, the pipeline may not be changed.
     |
     | You may have as many pipelines in your sitemap as you like.
