<h1>AstroGrid Registry Installer</h1>
Version @VERSION@.   Built @NOW@.
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<br>
This software will install the AstroGrid Registry component.<br>
Please read the following information before commencing installation.<br>
For information on this and other AstroGrid components see the
software site <a href="http://software.astrogrid.org">http://software.astrogrid.org</a>.
<br>
<b>Caveat:</b> Currently this installer only supports the most basic installation options,
and installs the registry with an internal database.  It is recommended
that the registry be installed with a separate database - see the
<a href="http://www.astrogrid.org/maven/docs/HEAD/registry/multiproject/astrogrid-registry/index.html">AstroGrid Software site</a>
more information on different configuration options.

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<ol>
  <li>A target machine running Tomcat 5.0 or higher, with the Manager
webapp enabled</li>
  <li>Username and password for the Manager webapp</li>
  <li>Java jdk 1.4 (probably present if you are reading this!)</li>
  <li>A connection to the internet the first time you run the installer</li>
</ol>
<h2>Installation</h2>
This installer will guide you through the installation process, downloading any necessary software and
prompting you for configuration options.  If you have previously installed a registry, you can use the installer
to remove this instance or reinstall it.  You will be prompted to save your settings for future use.
<br>
<b>Important Note</b><br>
If you are installing a Registry that is to be used and registered externally to the target machine you MUST
replace the installer-generated public URL with the full externally visible URL when prompted. 

<br>

<h2>Self-registration</h2>
Each registry must be registered with itself.  The installer can do this for you, or you can do it post installation using 
the registry's jsp pages.  Detailed documentation on this may be found on the <a href="http://www.astrogrid.org/maven/docs/HEAD/registry/multiproject/astrogrid-registry/index.html">AstroGrid Software site</a>.

<h2>Installing from behind a proxy/firewall</h2>
The installer attempts to download any files it needs from the AstroGrid repository.  If you are behind a firewall or use an internet proxy cache
see <a href="http://www.astrogrid.org/maven/docs/HEAD/installers.html">Firewalls/proxies</a>.

<h2>Install offline</h2>
If you have previously run the installer and downloaded the necessary files to your local disk, then you can rerun the installer in offline mode by passing the offline=true properties to the installer<br>
    <tt>java -jar (installer.jar) -Doffline=true</tt><br>
Other useful properties you can override on the commandline are:
<ul>
    <li><tt>maven.local.repo=${user.home}/.maven/repository</tt> location for the installer to download files</li>
    <li><tt>registry.war.name=astrogrid-registry-${version}.war</tt> the name of the war file to install</li>
    
</ul>
