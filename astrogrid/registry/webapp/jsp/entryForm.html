Below you will find example templates that you can copy/save and place into the text area.  Please do a "View Source" in
your web browser when copying. Currently version 0.9 is shown will add version 0.10 shortly since the Registry can now handle
either version or multiple versions.  Hint: on the links below might be best to open them up in a new window so you don't have to keep
coming back to this window.  Hopefully soon something will automatically load it into the text area for you.

This first section are examples, but also important to be used during the setup of a registry the first time.
<ul>
<li>
Use this Registry Type Service when setting up the Registry for the first time.  This should be the first
entry into the registry. This is the preferred template.  Please take it and fill it out correctly defining
your Registry.  Be sure if this is the first Registry Type then set the AuthorityID and ManagedAuthority elements to
what is defined in your properties.<br />
<a href="RegistryTypeWebServicev0_9.xml">Registry Type With Web Service Interface</a></li>
<li>This is another Registry Type as well that can be used, but uses the WebBrowser interface.  May be used if you do
not want harvests occuring via a Web Service.<br />
<a href="RegistryTypeWebBrowserv0_9.xml">Registry Type With Web Browser Interface</a></li>
<li>Add another authority id to be managed.  This is an Authority Type xml template to be used when defining more Authority id's
          <a href="AuthorityTypev0_9.xml">Authority Type</a></li>
</ul>

Below are just basic example templates that can be looked upon in understanding how to fill out the xml.
<ul>
<li>A basic service defined:<br />
<a href="Myspace.xml">Basic Service defined for Myspace</a></li>
<li>A basic siap service:<br />
<a href="INT-WFS-SIAP.xml">SIAP service</a></li>
<li>Data Center CEA Tool Defined and Service (example is 6df):<br />
<a href="6dFRegistryEntry.xml">6df datacenter CEA application entry</a>
<a href="6dfServiceRegistryEntry.xml">6df datacenter CEA service entry</a>
</li>
<li>A basic siap service:<br />
<a href="INT-WFS-SIAP.xml">SIAP service</a></li>
