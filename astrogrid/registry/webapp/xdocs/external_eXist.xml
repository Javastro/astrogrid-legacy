      <p>
      	 You will find a customized eXist at Astrogrid that has certain settings already set.
      	 Located <a href="http://www.astrogrid.org/maven/org.astrogrid/zips/external_eXist.zip">here</a><br />
      	 Here are the instructions on how to run and install eXist:
      	 <ul>
	      	 <li>Unzip it on a desired machine.</li>
	      	 <li>Typically good to set a environment variable EXIST_HOME to the location of the unzipped directory.</li>
	      	 <li>By default eXist will run on port 6080, if this is not desired you can change this in EXIST_HOME/tools/jetty/etc/jetty.xml change 6080 to desired port number.</li>
	      	 <li>Go to EXIST_HOME/bin and run startup.sh normally in the background so it is always going.</li>
	      	 <li>You may go to <a href="http://exist.sourceforge.net/quickstart.html">here</a> for info on installing as a service and other details about eXist.</li>
	      	 <li>When you come to configuration section of the Registry you will need to change a JNDI property "xmldb.uri" to xmldb:exist://{machinehost}:6080/exist/xmlrpc</li>
		</ul>

	  <section name="Installing eXist externally from eXist website">
		<p>
			You may for your own reasons want to install eXist straight from eXist website at http://exist.sourceforge.net.
			The download file is on the home page of eXist and see the <a href="http://exist.sourceforge.net/quickstart.html">quickstart guide</a> for 
			other info on installing such as on headless systems. <br />
		    Once installed here are some things to be customized for the astrogrid registry:
		    <ul>
		    	<li>in the bin/startup.sh (or startup.bat) you will see a -Xmx128000k advise to change to a higher memorry setting if you are to hold
		    	many entries such as -Xmx500M for 500mb.  Memory is not much of an issue as much with its now streaming api service, but advised to increase.</li>
		    	<li>in EXIST_HOME/conf.xml you will find two attributes that need to change:  caseSensitive needs to go to "no" and match-tagging-elements goes to "no"</li>		    	
		    	<li>Finally remember much like the above instructions to change your xmldb.uri JNDI property to your eXist and by default eXist runs on port 8080 this can be changed
		    	at EXIST_HOME/tools/jetty/etc/jetty.xml</li>
		   </ul>
