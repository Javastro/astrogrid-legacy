      <p>
         The installations below have mainly been tested on tomcat versions 5.0.19-5.0.28.  But the "Manual Installation" could be carried out on 
 other servlet/j2ee containers.  For the purpose of most instructions here the guide will refer to tomcat.
      <br />
      Download Location of war: http://www.astrogrid.org/maven/org.astrogrid/wars/
      <br />See astrogrid-registry-???.war  where ??? is a version number.  Look at dates for latest release.

      <subsection name="Manual installation/Drop-In - Preferred">
      <p>
         Most of the work is in the configure page, for installation. 
         <ul>
            <li>Take the war file and rename it if you do not like the name (be sure to keep the .war ending).  Typical names are "astrogrid-registry.war" or "registry.war"</li>
                <li>Now simply drop it into the webapps directory under where your tomcat is installed.</li>
                <li>Tomcat by default should unpack the war file into a directory in that webapps directory.  Directory Name should be the same as the war file minus the ".war" part.</li>
                <li><strong>Your done go to Configuration.</strong></li>
                <li>If it does not unpack it then you may have it turned off in your tomcat.  This will require you to deploy it through the tomcat manager.</li>
                <li>Go to your tomcat manager and login.  A link is found at the main tomcat page example if tomcat is on the local/same machine with default port set: http://localhost:8080</li>
                <li>If you relize you don't know how to login, then you will need to view a particular file located where you installed tomcat at: {tomcat install}/conf/tomcat-users.xml</li>
                <li>Unless your admin has setup tomcat to run on ldap or relational db for users; then this file should give you the username, password, and there roles for logging in.</li>
            <li>If this is a brand new tomcat then you will need to make a "manager" role and add it to a user or create a user in this file.  You should go ahead and add a "admin" as well for configuration purposes later.</li>
         </ul>
      </p>

      <subsection name="GUI Installer - Easy">
        <p> The registry may also be installed using a GUI installer that downloads the necessary software, installs it and configures it, prompting the user 
            for configuration settings. These may be saved to ease reinstallation. Currently, the installer only installs the registry in the simplest 
            "internal database" mode, but this, and other configuration settings can be modified post-installation as described on the <a 
            href="configure.html">configure</a> page.</p>
            <p> To download the installer and for further information, including how to run it on headless machines, see the <a 
                href="../../../installers.html">installers download page</a>. For further information on the configuration 
                settings you will need to supply, run the installer and read the welcome page. </p>
