      <p>
         The installations below have mainly been tested on tomcat versions 5.0.19-5.0.28.  But the "Manual Installation" could be carried out on 
 other servlet/j2ee containers.  For the purpose of most instructions here the guide will refer to tomcat.
      <br />
      Download Location of war: http://www.astrogrid.org/maven/org.astrogrid/wars/
      <br />See astrogrid-registry-???.war  where ??? is a version number.  Look at dates for latest release.

         Most of the work is in the configure page, for installation. 
         <ul>
            <li>Take the war file and rename it if you do not like the name (be sure to keep the .war ending).  Typical names are "astrogrid-registry.war" or "registry.war"</li>
                <li>Now simply drop it into the webapps directory under where your tomcat is installed.</li>
                <li>Tomcat by default should unpack the war file into a directory in that webapps directory.  Directory Name should be the same as the war file minus the ".war" part.</li>
                <li><strong>Your done go to Configuration.</strong></li>
                <li>If it does not unpack it then you may have it turned off in your tomcat.  This will require you to deploy it through the tomcat manager.</li>
                <li>Go to your tomcat manager and login.  A link is found at the main tomcat page example if tomcat is on the local/same machine with default port set: http://localhost:8080</li>
                <li>If you relize you don't know how to login, then you will need to view a particular file located where you installed tomcat at: {tomcat install}/conf/tomcat-users.xml</li>
                <li>Unless your admin has setup tomcat to run on ldap or relational db for users; then this file should give you the username, password, and there roles for logging in.</li>
            <li>If this is a brand new tomcat then you will need to make a "manager" role and add it to a user or create a user in this file.  You should go ahead and add a "admin" as well for configuration purposes later.</li>
         </ul>

         Most of the work is in the configure page, for installation.  This step is quite easy take the war
