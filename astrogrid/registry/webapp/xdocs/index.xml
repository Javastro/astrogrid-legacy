    	Welcome to the Registry Webapp Documentation.  
    	The Registry web application implements the full IVOA interface along with other
    	helpful pages to help query and update the Registry and harvest external IVOA registries.
    	
    	Look at the installation page to install the Registry to your servlet container such as tomcat.
    	Once installed all the documentation, query, updating, harvesting web application pages will
    	be located on your local site.  After installation you will need to continue with the Configuration page
    	to set particular properties up for your registry.  Once configuration is done you will have an
    	IVOA compliant Registry to use.
