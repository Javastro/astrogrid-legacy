    	Welcome to the Registry Webapp Documentation.  
    	In the menu on the left hand side you should find all the required information you
    	need.<br />
    	There have been many changes see "Changes" link, including WebStart GUI client and WebDav, support for 1.0 RI and others.<br />
    	The Registry at the moment is designed to work with databases that support the XMLDB:API.<br />
    	The Registry currently is bundled up with the eXist XMLDB and is the recommended database
    	for the Astrogrid Registry.<br />
    	For most Registries the bundled eXist is the easiest option.
    	For Larger Publishing Registries (holding thousands of Resources) or Full Registries that contain all Resources from 
    	all VO's we prefer eXist is installed as a seperate Database service.  Or you may have other reasons to have your Database
    	on a seperate machine.  Please see <a href="/external_eXist.html">external eXist</a> for more information on installing
    	eXist XMLDB externally.<br />
    	You may click on 'Home' in the menu to exit the 'Docs' area and go back to your main Registry home page.
