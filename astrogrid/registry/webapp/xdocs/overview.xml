         This is the main project to build a war file for deployment and that can be just dropped into a servlet/j2ee container.  
         It bundles the Axis
         web service toolkit along with all the necessary jar file dependencies such as astrogrid-registry-server.jar all into this
         war file.  It also bundles together two servlets that handle the OAI and a harvest daemeon.  See the deployment section below
         for configuring the registry.  The Registry is now more mulit-versioned where if necessary you can fairly easily by adding
         properties have the registry handle more than one version.
