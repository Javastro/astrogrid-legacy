         This page deals with uninstalling your registry.  If you are uninstalling this registry to never be used again and you have some xml 
 resources registered inside the registry.  And finally if you are being harvested meaning these xml registered resources are going out to other registries
then you must either: <br />
1.) Get another registry to manage your authority id hence your xml resources.
2.) Set all your xml resources to have a status attribute of "deleted".  Then it is best to wait a number of days to make sure your
xml resources have gone into other external registries.
      Now to uninstall:
         <ul>
            <li>First go into your Tomcat Manager (Read "Installation" section if your having trouble getting into it).</li>
            <li>Find your registry context and click on "undeploy".  This should delete the war file and the directory.
               <i>*If it doesn't then shutdown tomcat and delete it war file and directory, then start tomcat back up.</i></li>
            <li>Your registry is uninstalled, but your eXist xml database area may still be around if it is outside your webapp which is recommended.  If the xml database is not going to be used anymore then simply remove the main directory and all its files.</li>
         </ul>
