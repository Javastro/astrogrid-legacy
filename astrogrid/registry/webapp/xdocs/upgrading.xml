         This page deals with upgrading your registry.
         <strong>By default registry uses an xml database known as eXist embedded into its webapp and data is stored in the webapp.  If you have
not done so already it is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to read the "eXist With Registry Guide" on how to move the data out or at least know where the data is stored 
for coping back over if needed.  Otherwise all your data will be lost and have to re-add it through the jsp pages.</strong>
         <ul>
            <li>First go into your Tomcat Manager (Read "Installation" section if your having trouble getting into it).</li>
            <li>Find your registry context and click on "undeploy".  This should delete the war file and the directory.
               <i>*If it doesn't then shutdown tomcat and delete it war file and directory, then start tomcat back up.</i>
                </li>
            <li>Finally you just do the installation and configuration sections again.  In the configuration section
                you only need to change the properties in the Tomcat Administration area.  Be sure to change all properties like you had it before.</li>
         </ul>
