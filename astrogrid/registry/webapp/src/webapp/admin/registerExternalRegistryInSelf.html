<h1>Make your registry mirror another registry<br>
</h1>





<p>To mirror ("harvest") the contents of other registries, you must
collect their registryType entries and add those entries to your own
registry. The form below causes your registry to copy these entries
from a specific, external registry. Note that harvesting another
registry adds its contents to the contents of your registry; nothing in
your registry is lost or overwritten.<br>

<form action="registerExternalRegistryInSelf.jsp" method="post">
<p>
Please enter the URL for a registry to be harvested.
A default registry in AstroGrid is pre-set.
