<p>
This is the Installation Instructions for the Registry which currently requires several manual jobs, but is expected
to be easier in future iteration 05.  
</i>AssumptionsK/i>
<ul>
<li>These instructions assume you have access to the CVS system.</li>
<li>You have an Apache Tomcat server installed.</li>
<li>You have an Apache Axis installed <i>(For Server Side Install Only)</i>.</li>
<li>You have an Apache Cocoon installed <i>(For Client Side Install Only, must have access though to axis classes ex: axis.jar file can be used in cocoon)</i>.</li>
<li>A jconfig.jar file is accessible for both Server side and Client side access.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<i>Server Side</i>
<ul>
<li>From CVS Grab the registry-server-4_0.jar file located in astrogrid/registry/Release/server cvs location.</li>
<li>Place the registry-server-4_0.jar file in the axis/WEB-INF/lib directory.</li>
<li><i>Be sure the jconfg.jar file is also in this axis/WEB-INF/lib directory.</i></li>
<li>Make a config file.  A sample config file is in cvs under astrogrid/registry/src/config</li>
<li><i>The config file is now well documented please read it. It tells of cvs locations of where to find templates and example 
registry file plus the editing of a registry file which is required for new registries.</i></li>
<li><i>The example config file points to a more full Registry file, for setting up new registries please use and point in your config file
to another registry file.  An example sample registry is given in cvs at location astrogrid/registry/src/xml/
called new_registry_sample.xml.  Be sure to read this xml file for setting up your registry.</li>
<li>Edit the tomcat/webapps/axis/WEB-INF/web.xml file.  And an env-entry right before the "</web-app>" closing tag:.  An example entry is given below please change to
accomodate to your config file directory.
<i>
<env-entry>
<!--JNDI property for registry config-->
<env-entry-name>org.astrogrid.registry.config</env-entry-name>
<env-entry-value>C:\astro_registry_server.xml</env-entry-value>
<env-entry-type>java.lang.String</env-entry-type>
</env-entry>
</i>
</li>
<li>Start the tomcat server</li>
<li>deploy the registry wsdd files.  Normal command is java org.apache.axis.client.AdminClient <wsddfile>
	<li>astrogrid/registry/src/wsdd/adminquerydeploy.wsdd</li>
	<li>astrogrid/registry/src/wsdd/querydeploy.wsdd</li>
</li>
<li><b>Server side is complete</b></li>
</ul>
<br />
<i>Client Side</i>
<ul>
<li>Not much to say a portalB install is waht you need.</li>
<li><i>Be sure the jconfg.jar file is also in this cocoon/WEB-INF/lib directory.</i></li>
<li>Make a config file.  A sample config file is in cvs under astrogrid/registry/src/config</li>
<li><i>The config file is now well documented please read it. It tells of cvs locations of where to find templates and example 
registry file plus the editing of a registry file which is required for new registries.</i></li>
<li>Edit the cocoon/WEB-INF/web.xml file.  And an env-entry right before the "</web-app>" closing tag:.  An example entry is given below please change to
accomodate to your config file directory.

<env-entry>
<!--JNDI property for registry config-->
<env-entry-name>org.astrogrid.registry.config</env-entry-name>
