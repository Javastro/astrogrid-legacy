Cocoon Regigistry Browser
-------------------------

First install Cocoon in the Tomcat/webapps directory.

Then install the Astrogrid Cocoon Portal from the CVS. The following files for the Registry Query in Cocoon are included in the CVS, but the following files are included here if you want to install them seperately. They should be put in the directories relative to the 'webapps/cocoon' directory:

    astrogrid/html/agregistry.html
    astrogrid/xml/agregistry.xml
    astrogrid/xsl/agregistry.xsl
    astrogrid/xsp/agregistry.xsp
    astrogrid/xsl/agtemplate.xsl

The 'astrogrid/sitemap.xmap' file should be inserted into the 'astrogrid/sitemap' file.
