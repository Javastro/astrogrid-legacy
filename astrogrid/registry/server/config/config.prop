#Namespaces - Section
#This section allows you to define all the various namespaces used in this application (comma seperated)
#These namespaces are used only on the validation of xml files.  The namespaces are reset in the validation process
#to use the local schemas for validation out of the eXist db. Located at: exist.db.url/servlet/db/schemas
#The schemas are normally pre-loaded, but if they are not found then an attempt is made to extract them for the first time
#and upload them inot the schemas collection in th exist db.
#Notice the version number at the end
