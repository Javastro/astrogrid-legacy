			<p> This library contains object for data binding to standard IVOA schema. The binding technology that is used is
         <a href="https://jaxb.dev.java.net/">JAXB2</a>.</p>
         <p>The objects are originally automatically generated from the schema, but now include specific customizations so that when the schema change the objects will have to have
         these customizations reapplied - fortunately JAXB2 annotations make this process relatively painless. The schema that these objects will bind to are all contained in the "astrogrid contracts" project.
