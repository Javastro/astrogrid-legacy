This package contains a set of 'test dummy' Queriers, so that we can test
installations at various levels.
<p>
<b>DummyQuerier</b>
<p>The most basic is the DummyQuerier, which ignores the incoming query and just
returns a prepared VOTable document.

<p><b>TableQuerier</b>
This will have a simple HyperSQL database for running simple queries against.
