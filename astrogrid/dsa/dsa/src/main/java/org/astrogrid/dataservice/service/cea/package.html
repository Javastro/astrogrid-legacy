		<h1>CEA Provider for Datacenters</h1>
	<p>
  Main class : {@link org.astrogrid.datacenter.service.v06.DatacenterCEAComponentManager} defines a component manager
	configured to provide query access to a datacenter.
	<p />
  <p>
	It provides a description library containing a single application description- of type {@link org.astrogrid.datacenter.service.v06.DatacenterApplicationDescription}
	- which provides interfaces to perform a query via cone search, or via adql.
	<p />
  <p>
	Invocations of this application description are represented by {@link org.astrogrid.datacenter.service.v06.DatacenterApplication} objects.
	This class maps between the native asynchronous query interface provided by {@link org.astrogrid.datacenter.service.DataServer} and the protocol expected for a CEA provider.
  </p>
  <p>
    {@link org.astrogrid.datacenter.service.cea.CecServiceBinding} is an
    extension of the normal SOAP binding in the CEA library. The extension is
    to set handle properly the credentials such that credentials are not
    confused between jobs. In execute(), the credentials are cached
    in the {@link org.astrogrid.dataservice.service.cea.DatacenterApplication}
    class (the latter has a static map of SecurityGuard instances keyed by
    job-ID strings). The application instance uses the credentials to secure
    its connections to VOSpace and deletes them from the map at the end of
    its run() method.
