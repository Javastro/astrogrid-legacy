This package provides a set of identifiers that identify points where streams can be sent to (targetted) or received from (sourced),
and a set of classes for setting/getting types and streaming to/from such points.
<p>
The identities have a string form and include urls, myspace identifiers, IVORNs (that will resolve to storepoints) etc.  Wrapper classes
(such as IVORN and IVOSRN) provide parsing and validation.
<p>
'TargetIdentifiers' are not limited only to things that can be identified by a string; they are essentially anything that can be
streamed to, and so this includes http response streams, nulstreams, etc. Obviously targets that can be represented as a URI/string
can be forwarded from service to service for late resolving, whereas targets that cannot have to be 'relayed' to.  For example, if
a call to service A is in some way forwarded to another service B to be processed, then if the target at A was an http response stream,
then it will have to 'relay' the response from B to the caller.  If the target was identified by a string, it can be passed on to B
to resolve and stream to directly.
<p>
'SourceIdentifiers' are similar but for reading from.
<p>
Note that targets and sources are very simple; you can get/set the mime type and you can read/write to it.  More complex operations
such as setting ownership, date/time, etc belong to more complex packages such as storeclient, as many targets and sources do not
support such operations, and many operations only need simple read/write access to storepoints.
