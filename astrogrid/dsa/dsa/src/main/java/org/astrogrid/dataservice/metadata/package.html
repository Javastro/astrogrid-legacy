<h2>Metadata</h2>
Virtual Observatory components are expected to have somewhere a VODescription
document, which is an XML document consisting of one or more VOResource elements.
<p>
Datacenters expect to hold the master copy of their metadata, and serve this out
to registries (for example) on request.  Updates might also be 'pushed' to the
Registries.
<p>
This package provides classes that serve such VODescription documents by collecting
together from three sources: an AuthorityType plugin, the CEA resource from the CEA components,
and another 'body' plugin.  At some point I'll make this a bit clearer...
<p>
By default values for the AuthorityType Resource are read from the configuration file,
and the 'body' plugin reads the metadata from disk.
<p>
To create your own metadata generator, it must implement VOResourcePlugin, and
set the property datacenter.metadata.plugin to its class name.
