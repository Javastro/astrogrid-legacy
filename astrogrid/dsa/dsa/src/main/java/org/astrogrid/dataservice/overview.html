<h1>Datacenter Server</h1>


<h2>Back-end Plugin Interface</h2>
The service provider interface is defined in the {@link org.astrogrid.datacenter.queriers.spi} package.
The classes and interfaces in that package, and other classes used by them, form the public api.
<p>
This classes in this package won't change. much.
<p>
Any other classes are liable to change. Lots. Hence its not such a good idea to implement a plugin by extending 
{@link org.astrogrid.datacenter.queriers.Querier} - this is the old way of doing things.

<h2>Plugin Implementations</h2>
The datacenter server comes bundled with backend implementations for a range of databases - if your target database isn't available, try
the vanilla SQL package ({@link org.astrogrid.datacenter.queriers.sql}) .
