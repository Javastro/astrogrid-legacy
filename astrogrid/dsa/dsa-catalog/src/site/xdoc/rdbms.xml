    <p>
      In general, your shouldn't have to change your database to work with
      DSA/Catalogue; the web application is supposed to adapt to the database.
      However, you will need to set the user account (or "principal") in which
      name DSA connects to the RDBMS. You will also need to discover, from
      your RDBMS documentation, the form of the URL that identifies the
      JDBC connection.
    </p>
    <p>
      The account used to access the RDBMS should only have read/query
      privileges granted. <em>Do not</em> grant permissions to write to
      tables, create tables, delete tables, or to access other databases
      or tables than those that are to be published through DSA:
      these abilities are not needed and present a security risk.
