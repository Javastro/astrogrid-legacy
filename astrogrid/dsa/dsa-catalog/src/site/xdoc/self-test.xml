    <section name="DSA Self-tests">
      <p>
        Self tests are run from the main menu in the left-hand side-bar of the
        pages of the DSA/Catalogue web-application (NB: not from these
        documentation pages which are outside the web-application). Run the
        tests in the order in which they appear in the side-bar.
      </p>
      <p>
        You should run the tests with DSA/Catalogue's default configuration
        (i.e. before editing <i>astrogrid.properties</i> and again when you have
        configured the web-application for your installation. If it fails with
        the default configuration then either something is wrong with your
        war file or your Tomcat installation is not working properly. If it
        works with the default configuration and not with the configuration of
        choice then you need to inspect <i>astrogrid.properties</i> and
        the metadoc file for errors.
      </p>
      <p>
        The SQL-syntax test (the last test in the sequence) can take a long time
        to run. It is only worth running this test when you first configure for
        a new database, to check that the ADQL queries are translated to SQL
        properly. There are some known, harmless bugs in the standard translators;
        e.g. two of the test routinely fail for MySQL.
