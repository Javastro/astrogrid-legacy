    <p>
      Once you have configured your installation to talk to your database,
      you can make the web application generate the skeleton of the
      metadoc file by analysis of the database. This operation will fill in
      all the structural details concerning the database schema leaving you to
      add the scientific metadata.
    </p>
    <p>
      Go to the web-application pages with a web browser.
      Follow the link marked "generate template metadoc" in the left-hand
      side-bar. This will download the metadoc file into your browser. Use the
      "save as" command in the browser to sabe the result into your
      configuration directory as the file <i>metadoc.xml</i>. (The file-name
      and location is actually arbitrary, but it has to match what you
      wrote in <i>astrogrid.properties</i> and it helps to follow the naming
      convention.)
