<section name="Release notes for DSA/Catalogue 2009.1.02">

<p>
  This release provides an early implementation of the TAP v1.0 protocol.
  This is a prototype: some TAP features are not implemented and some are
  implemented imperfectly. The older interfaces still work, so upgrading
  a production service from v2009.1 is recommended. Any services running
  DSA/Catalogue 2009.1.01, the first TAP prototype, should definitely be
  upgraded.
</p>

<subsection name="TAP features">
  <p><i>Since v2009.1.01; security features since v2009.1.02.</i></p>
  <p>
    The following features of TAP are implemented:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>synchronous queries by ADQL;</li>
    <li>asynchronous queries by ADQL and UWS;</li>
    <li>VOSI.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    These features are not available in this release:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>queries by PQL, including positional queries using the POS parameter;</li>
    <li>metadata queries;</li>
    <li>table uploads;</li>
    <li>delivery of results to VOSpace.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Asynchronous queries via TAP leave their results in cache files on the server.
    These results remain available for 24 hours from the submission time of the
    query.
  </p>
  <p>
    <i>Since v2009.1.01.</i>
    In this release, IVOA single-sign-on authentication is implemented for the
    TAP interface; c.f. 2009.1.01. Access via TAP can be controlled.
  </p>
</subsection>

<subsection name="VOSI changes">
  <p><i>Since v2009.1.01.</i></p>
  <p>
    The VOSI resources have been rearranged to support the TAP implementation.
    In versions up to 2009, there was one set of VOSI resources for each catalogue configured
    on the web application. In 2009.1.01, there is one set of VOSI resources for
    the whole web application, but requests to those resources can be parameterized
    to get data concerning only one catalogue.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example, consider an service S configured to serve catalogues named
    C1 and C2. In v2009.1, there would have been these VOSI resources:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>http://where.ever/S/C1/vosi/capabilities</li>
    <li>http://where.ever/S/C1/vosi/availability</li>
    <li>http://where.ever/S/C1/vosi/tables</li>
    <li>http://where.ever/S/C1/vosi/ceaapplication</li>
    <li>http://where.ever/S/C2/vosi/capabilities</li>
    <li>http://where.ever/S/C2/vosi/availability</li>
    <li>http://where.ever/S/C2/vosi/tables</li>
    <li>http://where.ever/S/C2/vosi/ceaapplication</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    In v2009.1.02, the VOSI metadata are available through the following URIs:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>http://where.ever/S/VOSI/availability</li>
    <li>http://where.ever/S/VOSI/capabilities</li>
    <li>http://where.ever/S/VOSI/tables</li>
    <li>http://where.ever/S/VOSI/applications</li>
    <li>http://where.ever/S/VOSI/capabilities?COLLECTION=C1</li>
    <li>http://where.ever/S/VOSI/tables?COLLECTION=C1</li>
    <li>http://where.ever/S/VOSI/applications?COLLECTION=C1</li>
    <li>http://where.ever/S/VOSI/capabilities?COLLECTION=C2</li>
    <li>http://where.ever/S/VOSI/tables?COLLECTION=C2</li>
    <li>http://where.ever/S/VOSI/applications?COLLECTION=C2</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The basic, unparameterized resources return metadata for all catalogues.
    The <i>COLLECTION</i> parameter on the resource selects metadata for just
    one catalogue. The availability resource does not support this parameter.
  </p>
</subsection>

<subsection name="Records of queries">
  <p><i>Since v2009.1.01.</i></p>
  <p>
    The progress of queries used to be recorded in memory rather than on disc.
    This lead to DSA installations forgetting their queries when restarted.
    Further, when results of queries were not dispatched to VOSpace they too
    were kept in memory, leading to eventual failure of the service when the
    heap filled up.
  </p>
  <p>
    Starting with v2009.1.01, all results of queries are kept on disc, in a location
    specifed during configuration. Please
    see the description of the <a href="cache-directory.html">cache directory</a>
    for details.
  </p>
</subsection>

<subsection name="Upgrading from v2009.1">
  <p>
    The configuration files from the v2009.1 installation are mainly compatible
    with v2009.1.02:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>use the old context file.</li>
    <li>use the old metadoc file.</li>
    <li>two extra properties are needed in <i>astrogrid.properties</i>.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This is the recommended sequence for the upgrade.
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Delete the existing installation of DSA from Tomcat (use Tomcat's
      manager web-page and "undeploy" the context).
    </li>
    <li>
      In <i>astrogrid.properties</i>, add the property
      <i>datacenter.cache.directory</i>, as described in the
      <a href="cache-directory.html">document</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      In <i>astrogrid.properties</i>, add the property
      <i>tap.access.policy</i>. The value must be the fully-qualified name of
      the access-policy Java-class. If you already have access control on the
      CEC interface then you can use the same policy-class for TAP. If you
      want no access control on your TAP interface, then use the policy class
      <i>org.astrogrid.security.authorization.OpenAccessPolicy</i>. (This class
      is built in to DSA/Catalogue.)
    </li>
    <li>
      Create the cache directory if it does not exist. Make sure that the
      directory is writeable by the account running Tomcat.
    </li>
    <li>
      Deploy the new <i>.war</i> file into Tomcat (use the manager web-page,
      and make sure to specify the location of the context file, or else it will
      not see your configuration).
    </li>
    <li>
      Initialize the job database as described in the
      <a href="cache-directory.html">cache-directory document</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Refresh the registration to add the URIs for the new interfaces,
      as described in the <a href="registration.html">registration instructions</a>.
    </li>
  </ol>

    </li>
    <li>
      Delete all the files in the cache directory (the directory identified
      by the <i>datacenter.cache.directory</i> property in <i>astrogrid.properties</i>.
      V2009.1.02 uses a different schema for the job database that v2009.1.01, so the
      database has to be remade from scratch.
    </li>
    <li>
      Deploy the new <i>.war</i> file into Tomcat (use the manager web-page,
      and make sure to specify the location of the context file, or else it will
      not see your configuration).
