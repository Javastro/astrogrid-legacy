    <section name="Configuring DSA/Catalogue through its properties file">
      <p>
        Most of the general configuration, including the connection to the
        RDBMS, is set up by the file <i>astrogrid.properties</i>. You should
        have installed the default copy of <i>astrogrid.properties</i> when
        you made the <a href="configuration-directory.html">configuration directory</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        You should now work through <i>astrogrid.properties</i> changing the
        property values to suit your installation. Detailed advice on the
        meaning of the properties is in the comments of the file (any
        line beginning with "#" or "!" is a comment).
      </p>
      <p>
        The primary change you will make is to change
      </p>
      <pre>
  datacenter.querier.plugin=org.astrogrid.tableserver.test.SampleStarsPlugin
      </pre>
      <p>
        to
      </p>
      <pre>
  datacenter.querier.plugin=org.astrogrid.tableserver.jdbc.JdbcPlugin
      </pre>
      <p>
        This switches the data source for web application from its internal,
        dummy database to an external database connected via JDBC. When you make
        this change you must also set the properties for the JDBC URL, username
        and password.
      </p>
      <p>
        When setting the property <i>datacenter.metadoc.file</i>, change this
        to point to the file called <i>metadoc.xml</i> in your
        configuration directory. For the property value, put the absolute
        path to the file, e.g.
      </p>
      <pre>
  /astrogrid/hipparcos/metadoc.xml
      </pre>
      <p>
        rather than the URL for that file; i.e. don't put a <i>file://</i>
        prefix. This file doesn't exist yet: the web application will later
        create it for you.
      </p>
      <p>
        After setting properties you need to restart Tomcat for them to take
        effect.
