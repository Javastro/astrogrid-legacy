### Default configuration file for DSA/catalog servers
###
####################################################################
#
# By default, this file is installed in your DSA/catalog webapp's
# WEB-INF/classes directory, and is called "default.properties".
# By editing this file, you can configure the system properties for
# your DSA/catalog installation.
#
# However, if you customise this file, we recommend KEEPING A 
# BACKUP COPY OF IT SOMEWHERE OUTSIDE OF THE DSA/catalog WEBAPP.
# If you don't do this, your configuration information WILL BE LOST
# if the webapp is undeployed or upgraded. 
#
# Alternatively, if you are familiar with tomcat, you can move the 
# properties file outside the webapp, and use a tomcat environment
# property to specify where the properties file can be found; simply 
# set the property 'astrogrid.config.filename' for the installed
# webapp to the fully-qualified location of the properties file 
# (and be sure the file is in a location that is readable by tomcat).
# You can read more about this on the "Configuring your DSA/catalog"
# page in your installed DSA/catalog webapp.
#
#
# IMPORTANT NOTE ON DSA/catalog installation. 
# -------------------------------------------
# Note that your DSA/catalog should be installed (or accessible, e.g.
# via using httpd request forwarding) on either port 80 or port 8080 
# for full Virtual Observatory interoperability.
#
#
# Notes on the format of this file:
# ---------------------------------
#
# Comments in this file are preceded by the '#' character.
#
# Sample or disabled properties are preceded by the '!' character.
#
# Values which need to be replaced by a suitable local datum are
# enclosed in curly brackets, e.g. {replace_me}
#
#
# There are a number of properties to be configured, and as far as
# possible they are grouped together in logical collections.
#
# This file is intended to be self-documenting;  if you have 
# suggestions for clarifications or enhancements, please send 
# them to astrogrid_dsa@star.le.ac.uk.

####################################################################

# ==================================================================
# CRITICAL SETTINGS
# =================
# 
# All the properties in this file are important, but these two are 
# particularly critical for the operation of DSA/catalog self-tests.
#
#
# ----------
# This property sets the URL on which your DSA/catalog can be accessed.
# This URL MUST BE GLOBALLY VISIBLE as it will be used to tell the 
# Virtual Observatory how to reach your DSA/catalog;  a localhost 
# address WILL NOT work.  Uncomment the property below and configure
# it with the appropriate values.
# Example:  
#  datacenter.url=http://host.dept.uni.ac.uk:8080/astrogrid-dsa-catalog
# ----------

!datacenter.url=http://{your_full_host_address}:{your_port_number}/{path_to_your_webapp}/


# ----------
# This property sets the location of the "metadoc file" for your data.
# This file contains an XML description of the format of your data
# (tables and column descriptions, with additional information about
# IVOA UCDs etc).
# ----------
#
# We recommend CONFIGURING THIS SETTING LAST.  If you first configure
# access to your database (described below), and restart the DSA/catalog 
# webapp or tomcat, then you can use the "admin/GenerateMetaDoc" page in 
# this DSA/catalog's web interface to create a skeleton metadoc file 
# for your data, by visiting this address (customised with your local 
# installation details):
# 
#    http://{your_full_host_address}:{your_port_number}/{path_to_your_webapp}/admin/generateMetaDoc
#
# Note that at this point, some of the DSA/catalog self-tests will be 
# failing because an inconsistent metadoc file is in use; you can ignore 
# this failure temporarily.  

# The skeleton metadoc file you have thus created will require some 
# manual enhancement, as described in this DSA/catalog installation's 
# "Configuring your DSA/catalog" web interface pages:
#
#    http://{your_full_host_adddress}:{your_port_number}/{path_to_your_webapp}/configure.jsp
# 
# Once you have edited the metadoc file, put it somewhere outside the 
# installed webapp and then make sure you supply a fully-qualified path 
# to it in the property below, and that it has file permissions allowing 
# tomcat to read it.

!datacenter.metadoc.file={/full/path/to/your.metadoc.xml}


# ==================================================================
# DATABASE CONNECTION SETTINGS
# ============================
#
# Properties involved in connecting to the dataset in the RDBMS.
#
# The DSA/catalog architecture is "pluggable", i.e. "plugin" modules 
# can be written to handle local data connection requirements without 
# revision to the core DSA/catalog engine.
#
# Two standard plugins are currently supplied, which should hopefully
# be adequate for most users.  
#
# For testing purposes, a test plugin with classname
# 'org.astrogrid.tableserver.test.SampleStarsPlugin' is supplied;  
# this creates and accesses a small test database using the HSQLDB java
# database that is included in the DSA/catalog installation.
#
# For access to your own RDBMS data, a JDBC plugin is supplied
# with classname 'org.astrogrid.tableserver.jdbc.JdbcPlugin', to
# allow the DSA/catalog to connect to your database via the JDBC 
# architecture.
# (NB This plugin requires that your RDBMS vendor supplies a JDBC driver 
# for the RDBMS;  as far as we know, all the major vendors do this).
# If your RDBMS doesn't support JDBC, you will need to provide a 
# customised plugin; you may wish to contact astrogrid_dsa@star.le.ac.uk
# for some advice with this.
#
# ------------------------------------------------------------------ 
# An example plugin for initial tests 
# ------------------------------------
# This property activates the default test plugin.
# You should comment it out once you are ready to connect to your
# real data instead of a test infrastructure.
#
datacenter.querier.plugin=org.astrogrid.tableserver.test.SampleStarsPlugin


# ------------------------------------------------------------------ 
# A JDBC plugin for real RDBMS access
# ----------------------------------
#
# We hope that this JDBC plugin should work for most common RDBMS systems.
#
# Comment out the test plugin setting above, and uncomment the
# relevant properties below (by removing the leading '!' character).
#
# Note that you will also need to copy the JDBC jar for your RDBMS 
# into your DSA/catalog webapp's WEB-INF/lib directory (remember to 
# restart the webapp after doing so, to be sure the jar is in the
# webapp's classpath).

# ----------
# This property tells the DSA to use the JDBC Plugin
# ----------

!datacenter.querier.plugin=org.astrogrid.tableserver.jdbc.JdbcPlugin

# ----------
# This property tells the plugin whether the RDBMS expects trigonometric
# function arguments in radians or not (set to "false" if RDBMS trig 
# functions use degrees).
# ----------

!db.trigfuncs.in.radians=true

# ----------
# This property tells the JDBC plugin whether to disable "autocommit" when 
# communicating with the RDBMS via JDBC.
# By default this property is true, which is the correct setting for most 
# systems.
# You may need to uncomment this if you have problems communicating with
# a Sybase RDBMS.
!datacenter.plugin.jdbc.disableautocommit=false

# ----------
# These properties tell the DSA what username and password to use for JDBC 
# access to the RDBMS (this user account obviously needs to exist/be 
# configured within your RDBMS).
# IT IS STRONGLY ADVISED THAT THE JDBC USER ACCOUNT BE READ-ONLY - so
# the JDBC username should have no permission to modify the database.
# ----------

!datacenter.plugin.jdbc.user={jdbc_username}
!datacenter.plugin.jdbc.password={jdbc_password}

# ----------
# These properties tell the JDBC infrastructure how to connect to the
# RDBMS.  Insert the details of your JDBC driver class and connection URL 
# (you can base this on one of the templates below if using one of the
# specified RDBMS systems, and/or refer to the JDBC section of your RDBMS 
# documentation.)

# ----------
# Settings for SQL translation.
# The JDBC plugin by default uses an XSLT-based mechanism to produce
# suitable SQL queries from incoming ADQL/XML queries.  We need to
# specify which XSLT stylesheet the RDBMS should use.  
# The following stylesheets ship with the DSA;  choose the one most
# appropriate to your RDBMS.  If your DSA fails its SQL syntax tests,
# you will need to provide a customised stylesheet that produces the
# correct SQL.
# ----------

# (likely to work with other versions of SQLServer too)
!datacenter.sqlmaker.xslt=SQLSERVER-8.00.xsl

# For MySQL 4.1.16

!datacenter.sqlmaker.xslt=/full/path/to/your/stylesheet.xsl


# ==================================================================
# RESOURCE RESTRICTION SETTINGS
# =============================
# 
# These properties allow you to set crude usage limitations to avoid 
# overloading or large-scale data-mining of your DSA/catalog, if you wish.

# Limits number of rows that can be returned by any single query 
# (equivalent to using SQL "TOP" or "LIMIT").   
# NB A value of 0 indicates no limit.  
datacenter.max.return=50000

# These properties limit the number of queries to be processed simultaneously.
#
# For asynchronous queries, queries in excess of the limit will be queued 
# until one or more of the active queries completes).
#
# For synchronous queries (e.g. traditional conesearch), queries in excess of 
# the limit will be rejected with a "Try again later" message (there is no
# point queueing them, as the synchronous client will likely time out waiting
# for them to be run.
#
# Having two separate properties (to replace the old "datacenter.max.queries"
# property) allows administrators to decide which kind of jobs to prefer.
# It may be better to allow more synchronous queriers and fewer asynchronous
# ones, since over-the-limit asynchronous queries will still get run eventually,
# whereas over-the-limit synchronous queries will actively fail.
datacenter.max.sync.queries=15
datacenter.max.async.queries=15

# This properties sets the maximum "age" of a completed job in the 
# in-memory job history, in days.  Job histories for jobs older than this 
# will be deleted to conserve memory.
datacenter.flush.interval=7

# Limits run-time for each query.  
# NB A value of 0 indicates no limit
#
# Note that setting this value to some finite time will NOT cause 
# the SQL query running on the actual RDBMS to be terminated;  it
# will just kill off the datacenter's monitoring and results 
# delivery for any query has been running for more than the 
# specified time.
datacenter.sql.timeout=0


# ==================================================================
# SELF-TEST SETTINGS
# ==================
# The DSA/catalog server has a suite of self-tests designed to 
# check that ADQL/XML queries are being translated into SQL compatible
# with your back-end RDBMS.
#
# The self-test infrastructure uses a series of templated ADQL/XML 
# queries; it plugs a real table name and real column names into
# the templates in order to produce SQL that will actually run against
# your data in your RDBMS.
#
# The properties below tell the self-test infrastructure the names of 
# the table and columns to use in populating the templated queries.
#
# The columns chosen should be some kind of floating-point number;
# RA and DEC are ideal if they exist in your database.
# If your data has no floating-point columns, you can try integer
# columns instead;  however, some syntax self-tests may fail if your
# RDBMS is picky about automatic type promotions.
#
# !! IMPORTANT NOTE:  The DSA metadoc file allows catalog, table and 
# column names to be described in both an ID attribute and a Name
# tag. The ID attribute reflects the SYSTEM NAME and should always be 
# set to the catalog/table/column name as it appears in the RDBMS;  
# the Name tag reflects the PUBLICATION NAME and can optionally be set 
# to something more user-friendly.  (See the webapp's embedded
# documentation for more about system and publication names).
#
# The self-test settings below should use SYSTEM NAMES (i.e. the values
# in the metadoc's ID attributes), representing the real RDBMS names
# for tables and columns.
#
!datacenter.self-test.catalog={a_database_in_your_RDBMS}
!datacenter.self-test.table={a_table_in_that_database}
!datacenter.self-test.column1={a_floating_point_column_in_that_table}
!datacenter.self-test.column2={another_floating_point_column_in_that_table}

# ==================================================================
# GENERAL QUERY SETTINGS
# ======================

# When an incoming ADQL query doesn't specify the table to which it
# should be applied (which is undesirable, but is legal ADQL 1.0),
# the table defined by the 'default.table' property is used to choose
# the table to apply the query to.   
#
# If you only have one table in your dataset, or one major table,
# it makes sense to set the 'default.table' property to the name 
# of this table.
#
# If you leave the property unset or blank, ADQL queries that do not
# specify the target table will be rejected.

# Set to the Name (publication name - contents of the Name tag) of a 
# table in your metadoc, or leave blank/unset
!default.table={a_table_name_in_your_metadoc}

# VOTable output uses Unified Content Descriptors to describe the
# nature of different columns in the data.  This property specifies
# version of the UCD specification to use.
# Allowed values here are '1' (for UCD v.1) or '1+' (for UCD v.1+).
#
# UCD v.1 is now deprecated.  However, some services do not yet
# deal with UCD v.1+, so we recommend leaving this property set to 
# v.1 for the time being.
#
# In particular, if you are enabling the conesearch interface
# (see below), PLEASE USE UCD v.1 for now as the conesearch standard
# requires it.
#
# PLEASE POPULATE YOUR METADOC FILE USING BOTH VERSIONS OF THE UCD 
# STANDARD, FOR FUTURE UPGRADEABILITY.
datacenter.ucd.version=1

# ==================================================================
# CONE-SEARCH INTERFACE SETTINGS
# ==============================
# The DSA/catalog server provides an IVOA "cone-search" interface.
# This simple interface accepts a Right Ascension, Declination and 
# search radius in decimal degrees.  You can configure one or more
# tables in your catalogue(s) by putting the appropriate entries 
# in your metadoc file.
#
# Supplying a conesearch interface to your data probably only makes sense
# if that data is contains at least one table with RA and Dec coordinates 
# for each row.  
# If you don't want to provide a standard conesearch interface at all, 
# or wish to disable it temporarily without changing your metadoc 
# configuration, set this property to false.  
# Note that the CEA "conesearch" application will always be available if 
# tables in your metadoc are specified as conesearchable, even if the
# following property is set to false;  this gives you the ability
# to switch off the *unsecured* standard consearch interface while
# still providing conesearch capabilities via the *secured* CEA
# interface.
datacenter.implements.conesearch=true

# The "MultiCone" service is a service which permits crossmatching between
# a submitted table from a client and a table on the server.  It works by
# doing a sequence of cone searches, one for each row of the submitted table,
# and uses the same table configuration as the cone search service.
# If either this property or datacenter.implements.conesearch is set false,
# MultiCone will be disabled.
datacenter.implements.multicone=true
# By default, the multicone implementation sidesteps the normal DSA
# ADQL querying infrastructure and connects directly to the database.
# This means, for example, that multicone queries don't show up in
# the DSA webapp status page.  If you want to use the (slightly slower)
# ADQL infrastructure (e.g. so you can monitor queries, or because
# your JDBC driver doesn't support the direct implementation), then
# set the following property to true.
datacenter.multicone.forceadql=false

# Limit the maximum search radius allowed for conesearches, and for
# multicone searches (you may want a smaller limit on multicone searches
# as these can load the server more heavily).
# The limit is specified in decimal degrees; a limit of "0" means no limit.
# For example, "conesearch.radius.limit=1.0" will cause conesearches
# with a radius of >1.0 decimal degrees to be rejected.
conesearch.radius.limit=0
multicone.radius.limit=0

# ==================================================================
# VIRTUAL OBSERVATORY SETTINGS
# ============================
# To be useful as part of the Virtual Observatory, this DSA/catalog
# server needs to publish some information about itself.  
# These properties are used to describe the DSA/catalog's interfaces 
# and data so that it can be discovered and utilised by Virtual 
# Observatory tools and their human users.

# ----------
# These two properties are aimed at human readers - change them
# to reflect your own installation details.  The sample entries 
# below describe the default test configuration of the DSA/catalog 
# installation.
# ----------
datacenter.name={AstroGrid DSA/catalog running test dataset}
datacenter.description={This is a default (unconfigured) DSA/catalog installation.  It accesses a small HSQLDB database containing fictitious tables of stars and galaxies for testing and demonstration purposes.}

# ----------
# The following settings are for configuring "VOResources", which are XML 
# descriptions of the DSA/catalog server, its interfaces and data,
# intended to be stored in VO-compliant "registries" of such descriptions.
#
# These settings are very important, as together they comprise a unique
# identifier for this resource in the Virtual Observatory.
# The Authority ID is a unique identifier for your organisational unit,
# e.g. star.le.ac.uk);  see 
# http://wiki.astrogrid.org/bin/view/Deploy/InstallationNotesAuthorityID
# for more about authority IDs.
# The Resource Key is a unique identifier for this particular resource,
# e.g. USNOB_DSA.  Your Authority ID must manage no other resources with 
# this name;  the Authority ID / Resource Key pair must be globally unique.
# Consult your Registry administrator for advice about what Authority ID
# you should use.  

# These are test values, which work with the default test plugin
datacenter.authorityId=astrogrid.org
datacenter.resourceKey=test-dsa-catalog

# You need to remove the test values above, and replace them with your own 
# authority ID and resource key:
!datacenter.authorityId={please.specify.me}
!datacenter.resourceKey={SpecifyMe}

# ----------
# Choose which version(s) of the VOResources standard to use for 
# registering this DSA/catalog installation. 
# Use a value of "enabled" to enable the specified version, and 
# a value of "disabled" to disable it.
datacenter.resource.register.v1_0=enabled

# ==================================================================
# REGISTRY SERVICES
# =================
#
# This DSA/catalog installation needs to register its own resources in
# the same "Publishing registry" that publishes the installation's 
# Authority ID registration (see Authority ID discussion above).
#
# Additionally, this installation will sometimes need to search a VO 
# "Querying registry" in order to resolve VOSpace addresses (such as 
# destination IVORNs where it should put query results).
#
# This is the "publishing registry" used when this DSA/catalog needs to 
# register its resources.  It must be the same registry where the DSA/catalog's
# Authority ID is registered.  (Note that the admin endpoint uses the
# RegistryUpdate interface of this registry.)
datacenter.publishing.registry=http://galahad.star.le.ac.uk:8080/astrogrid-registry/

# This is the "querying registry" used to resolve VOSpace addresses.  
# It should be reasonably high performance and/or close by, but it doesn't 
# have to belong to your organisation or manage your Authority ID.
# (Note that the query endpoint uses the RegistryQuery interface of this 
# registry.)
org.astrogrid.registry.query.endpoint=http://galahad.star.le.ac.uk:8080/astrogrid-registry/services/RegistryQuery

# This is the alternative querying registry, used if the main querying 
# registry is unavailable.
org.astrogrid.registry.query.altendpoint=http://harvesting-registry.roe.ac.uk/astrogrid-registry/services/RegistryQuery


# ==================================================================
# MISC. OTHER PROPERTIES
# ======================
#
# Enable http-chunking support for large file transfers (to avoid
# buffer overflow errors).
# YOU SHOULD *NOT* NEED TO DISABLE THIS PROPERTY, BUT NOTE THAT 
# HTTP-CHUNKING WILL ONLY WORK IN JAVA 1.5!  
# YOU SHOULD RUN THIS DSA/catalog IN JAVA 1.5 (NOT 1.4).
org.astrogrid.filestore.chunked.send=enabled

# DON'T CHANGE OR REMOVE THIS ONE!  It's a required property.
cea.component.manager.class=org.astrogrid.dataservice.service.cea.DatacenterCEAComponentManager

# ----------
# These set whether CEA tasks should be stored in memory or on disk, 
# and if so, where.  The default is in memory, so you only need to 
# uncomment/configure these properties if you want the CEA interface 
# to store jobs to disk.
# ----------
!cea.persistence.backend=file
!cea.filestore.basedir=/tmp/  (defaults to container's default directory)


# Access control.
# This defines a Java class plugged in to the server to enforce access policy.
# The class must be named in full - i.e. state its package as well as the class
# name - and must be on the classpath of the web-application. That latter point
# means that the class file must be in one of these places:
#  - in a JAR in the WEB-INF/lib directory of the installed web-application;
#  - loose, in the WEB-INF/classes directory of the installed web-application;
#  - in a JAR in the common/lib directory of Tomcat;
#  - loose, in the common/classes directory of the installed web-application.
# You should change this property to impose your own access policy.
# The default policy allows all requests: no access control at all. If you
# don't want to restrict access to your data, don't fiddle with the default!
# Failing to specify an access policy (by removing this property altogether)
# is not a way to remove access controls and will cause all queries to your
# service to fail.
cea.access.policy=org.astrogrid.security.authorization.OpenAccessPolicy
