<h1>AstroGrid data warehouse: front-end service</h1>

<p>
This web-application holds the front-end web-service for the AstroGrid
Grid Data Warehouse; it is a facade through which clients can access the
warehouse without dealing directly with Grid protocols. The warehouse
web-service currently has exactly the same interface as AstroGrid's data-centre
component.
</p>

<p>
The warehouse service is a SOAP service built on Apache-Axis, so it must be
driven by a dedicated SOAP client (the classes in AstroGrid's data-centre
component are suitable) rather than through these web pages.  However, 
some test functions are available via your web-browser.
