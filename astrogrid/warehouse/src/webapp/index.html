<h1>AstroGrid data warehouse: front-end service</h1>

<p>
This web-application holds the front-end web-service for the AstroGrid
Grid Data Warehouse; it is a facade through which clients can access the
warehouse without dealing directly with Grid protocols. The warehouse
web-service currently has exactly the same interface as AstroGrid's data-centre
component.
<p>

<p>
The warehouse service is a SOAP service built on Apache-Axis, so it must be
driven by a dedicated SOAP client (the classes in AstroGrid's data-centre
component are suitable) rather than through these web pages.  However, Axis
provides the following administrative functions via your web browser.
</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="happyaxis.jsp">Validate</a>
        the local installation's configuration<br>
        <i>see below if this does not work.</i></li>
    <li><a href="servlet/AxisServlet">View</a>
        the list of deployed Web services</li>
    <li><a href="EchoHeaders.jws?method=list">
        Call a local endpoint</a> that list's the caller's
        http headers (or see its
        <a href="EchoHeaders.jws?wsdl">WSDL</a>). 
    <li><a href="http://xml.apache.org/axis">Visit</a>
        the Apache-Axis Home Page</li>
    <li><a href="servlet/AdminServlet">Administer Axis</a> <br>
        [disabled by default for security reasons]</li>
    <li><a href="SOAPMonitor">SOAPMonitor</a> <br>
        [disabled by default for security reasons]</li>
</ul>

<p>
To enable the disabled features, the maintainer of this service should 
uncomment the appropriate declarations in 
<i>WEB-INF/web.xml</i> in the web-application and restart it.
</p>

<h3>Validating Axis</h3>

<p>
If the "happyaxis" validation page displays an exception instead of a 
status page, the likely cause is that the server of the web-application
has multiple XML parsers in its classpath.
</p>

<p>
If you have problems getting Axis to work, consult the Axis 
<a
href="http://nagoya.apache.org/wiki/apachewiki.cgi?AxisProjectPages">Wiki</a>
and then try the Axis user mailing list.
