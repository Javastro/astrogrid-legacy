The front-end web-service is released as an AstroGrid component; the 
back-end grid-service is not. There is nothing "secret" about the back-end 
service, but it is harder to install and configure than the front-end 
service. For now, AstroGrid offers a pre-installed back-end service at 
http://hydra.star.le.ac.uk:8082/gdw/. The released software is 
preconfigured to use this back-end service. Please see 
GdwCataloguesIteration4 for a list of data-sets installed in the back-end 
service. 

The web interface for a test query times out if the query runs longer than 
about two minutes. This interface is not intended for long tests. 

It is impossible to install the warehouse front-end service in the same 
Tomcat as a datacenter installation because the entries in 
AstroGridConfig.properties clash. This is due to warehouse being a 
specialized form of datacenter and re-using many classes from the latter 
component. We hope to remove this limitation in a later release.
