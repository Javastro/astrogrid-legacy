				<P> The latest build is Itn07 Snapshot.</P>
                <P>
                    This code is the "bleeding-edge" code that is rebuilt several times daily and deployed to a 
                    "nursery" test area.  It comes with no guarantees that it will function correctly, or even compile.
                </P>
                <P>
                    The Snapshot code is installed on <a href="http://cadairidris.star.le.ac.uk:8080/astrogrid-portal">Cadairidris:8080</a>.

			<subsection name="Itn07 Head">
                <P> Head code has been tested and accepted by the integration team.  
                    It is guaranteed to build, and in
                    general its integration test pass rate will increase monotonically with time.</P>
                    <P>Accepted code is deployed as needed to <a href="http://twmbarlwm.star.le.ac.uk:8080/astrogrid-portal">twmbarlwm:8080</a>, but be aware 
                        that this machine can be withdrawn for use by the integration team without notice.</P>
