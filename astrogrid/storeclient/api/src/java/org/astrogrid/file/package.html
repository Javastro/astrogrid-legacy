<h2>File API</h2>
A package to provide a single straightforward access to filesystems.  It includes
an interface definition and implementations for File and ZipFile, for accessing
local filesystems.
<p>NB It is not meant to provide fancy stuff like threaded updates or monitoring;
it provides only a common interface for a variety of access methods. (Implementations
will probably need to include 'Principal's in the file constructors for secure access).
<p>I can't quite see how a factory would work at the moment - presumably off some
kind of URN that has a scheme that defines the file, but this needs some more thought
<p>
etc
