      <p>
        This version of the community has the following changes from version
        2007.2.
      </p>
      <subsection name="Certificate authority support"/>
      <p>
        The internal certificate-authority for the community is now
        fully supported and is part of the normal installation. Instructions
        on how to make and install the certificate authority's files
        are included in the web application.
      </p>
      <p>
        A generator for the certificate-authority files (root certificate,
        private key, serial-number record) is now available. This is a
        separate artifact from the community web-application and must be
        downloaded separately. The web-application documents explain where to
        get the generator and how to use it.
      </p>
      <subsection name="Menus simplified">
        <p>
          The administration menu has been simplified. Several functions
          that were never properly supported have been withdrawn.
        </p>
      </subsection>
      <subsection name="MyProxy support">
        <p>
          MyProxy is now a normal part of the installation; a community
          cannot function fully unless MyProxy is present. Minimal installation
          instructions have been added.
        </p>
      </subsection>
      <subsection name="DB installation no longer needed">
        <p>
          There is no longer any need to install the DB software. It is 
          always packaged in the WAR.
        </p>
