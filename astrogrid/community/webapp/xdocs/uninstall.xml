         This page deals with uninstalling your community. 
      Now to uninstall:
         <ul>
            <li>First go into your Tomcat Manager (Read "Installation" section if your having trouble getting into it).</li>
            <li>Find your community context and click on "undeploy".  This should delete the war file and the directory.
               <i>*If it doesn't then shutdown tomcat and delete it war file and directory, then start tomcat back up.</i>
                </li>
            <li>Your community is uninstalled</li>
         </ul>
