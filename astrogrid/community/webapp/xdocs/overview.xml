       <p>
         The community software provides a means to register IVO users, and
         to provide them with credentials so that they can access restricted
         resources. The community is supplied as a web application that
         provides a number of services.
       </p>
     <dl>    
       <dt>Security service:</dt>
           <dd>a SOAP service that allows users to authenticate with passwords.</dd>
           <dd>
           This service is obsolecent since it does not supply the credentials
           needed for modern, secure services. It is 
           retained for compatibility with old
           clients of MySpace.</dd>
       <dt>Policy manager:</dt>
       <dd>a SOAP service with reports to the client the IVORN for the user's
       home space.</dd>
       <dd>This is also obscelecent.</dd>
       <dt>Accounts service:</dt>
       <dd>a RESTful web-service that dispenses credentials.</dd>
       <dd>This service replaces the SOAPy security service. It will later
           be extended to replace the policy manager.</dd>
       <dt>Administration interface:</dt>
       <dd>a classical web-browser interface for the community operators.</dd>
     </dl>
     
     <p>
       The community contains a local certificate authority, operated by the
       community managers through the community's administration interface.
