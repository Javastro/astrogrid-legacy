      <p>
        If you followed the standard procedure for installing the
        community, and used the standard directory layout then you
        have community software in inside Tomcat and community
        configuration under <i>/astrogrid/community</i>. To upgrade
        the software, first undeploy the web application using Tomcat's
        manager page, then 
        <a href="standard-webapp.html">reinstall the web-application</a>
        using the old, saved <a href="standard-context">context-file</a>.
        The new software will then use the old configuration, database and
        user-credentials.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before upgrading, please read the release notes to see if you need
        to change anything in your configuration.
