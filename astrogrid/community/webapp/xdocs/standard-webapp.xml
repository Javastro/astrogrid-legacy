      <p>
        If you have followed the standard installation-procedure, you now have
        to hand a web application in a web-archive (the <i>.war</i> file) and a
        context file (the XML file with the <i>Environment</i> elements).
        The most reliable way to install these is via Tomcat's manager page,
        using the panel labeled "deploy directory or WAR file located on server".
      </p>
      <p>
        Copy your <i>.war</i> file and your context file onto the server in
        a directory outside the Tomcat installation. Go to the mamaner page
        with your web browser.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fill in the context-path field. The value here is the path in the URL
        leading to the front page of the web application. E.g., if your
        web application is to go at <i>http://foo.bar/community</i>, then
        the value for the context path is <i>/community</i>; the leading slash
        is essential. Note that the
        context path must match the URLs that you declared for the community
        when setting up the context file.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fill in the locations of the <i>.war</i> and context files. These values
        of these fields must be URLs, so prepend <i>file:</i> to the file
        paths.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now press the button to deploy the web application. Tomcat should
        deploy it and add it to the list within a few seconds.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of the handful of ways to add a web application to Tomcat, this one
        is the most reliable. I strongly recommend that you do it this way.
