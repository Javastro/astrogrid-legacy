<h1>Administration commands</h1>

<p>
Using the menu on this page, you can use all the administration
functions of the community.
However, functions <em>only</em> accessible from this page are 
experimental and you should not need to use them on a production community.
The functions recommended for regular use are all accessible from the
front page of the community.
