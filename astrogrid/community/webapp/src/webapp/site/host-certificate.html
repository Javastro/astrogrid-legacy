Notes on generating a host certificate</h2>
<p>
        You need an identity certificate for your host computer in order to 
        serve pages over HTTPS. The nature of the host certificate determines
        whether the HTTPS client will trust the community service. If the
        client does not trust the host certificate then it aborts the HTTPS
        exchange and your service fails.
      </p>
<p>
        There are, broadly, four ways to get a host certificate:
      </p>
<ol type="1"><li>use any old certificate you already have;</li>
<li>buy a certificate from a commercial certificate authority (CA);</li>
<li>get a free certificate from your academic CA;</li>
<li>generate your own certificate and sign it as if you were a CA.</li>
</ol>
<p>
        The first option <em>doesn't work</em>. Clients will not trust a
        host certificate unless the common-name (CN) part of the distinguished
        name (DN) in the certificate is the name of the host. You can't use
        your personal certificate as a host certificate.
      </p>
<p>
        The second option is expensive and the third can be painful. The rest
        of these note describe the fourth option using a &quot;self-signed&quot;
        certificate.
      </p>
<p>
        Here is an example of generating a self-signed, host certificate using
        the <i>keytool</i>
 utility in the SUN JDK.
      </p>
<pre>
        keytool -genkey -alias tomcat -keyalg RSA -validity 365 \
            -keystore host.jks -storetype JKS \
            -dname &quot;C=UK,O=Example University,OU=Astronomy,CN=ivo.example.ac.uk&quot;
      </pre><p>
        The <strong>alias</strong> allows the Tomcat software to pick out the 
        right certificate from a keystore that may contain more than one such.
        Tomcat assumes the alias <i>tomcat</i>
.
      </p>
<p>
        The <strong>key algorithm</strong> can be RSA or DSA. Most tests of
        the community use RSA.
      </p>
<p>
        The <strong>validity period</strong>, which is in days, should be
        longer than <i>keytool's</i>
 default of 90 days. A year is reasonable,
        and you might choose to make the certificate valid for 10 years. You
        will need to renew the certificate before it expires, by repeating
        the current procedure.
      </p>
<p>
        The name of the file in which you store the credentials 
        (<i>host.jks</i>
 in the example above) can be anything you like, but
        the <strong>store type</strong> should be JKS as Tomcat's support for
        other types is questionable. Therefore, the file-name should end in
        <i>.jks</i>
. You will need to edit Tomcat's confguration to tell it
        which key-store file to use.
      </p>
<p>
        The <strong>distinguished name</strong> must be globally unique,
        should identify the operation hosting the service and <em>must</em>
        have the correct common-name component. In the example above, C stands 
        for country, O stands for organization, OU stands for organizational
        unit (typically a department within the organization) and CN stands
        for common name. The value of the common name is the fully-qualified
        host-name of the computer <em>as seen by the client</em></p>
<p>
        &quot;Fully-qualified host-name of the computer as seen by the client&quot;
        mean a host visible via HTTP outside your site. In the example above,
        a user should be able to type <i>http://ivo.example.ac.uk/</i>
 into a
        web-browser and get the default page of the Tomcat installation.
      </p>
<p><i>keytool</i>
 will prompt for a password to secure the private key and
        another to secure the key-store as a whole. You should set both of these
        to &quot;changeit&quot; since Tomcat assumes this password. You could use a
        different password but you would then need to write it down, in clear
        text, in Tomcat's configuration, so this does not add much security.
