      <subsection name="Generation of proxy certificates by accounts service">
        <p>
          In 2008.0, when the accounts service generated a certificate chain, 
          it made the proxy certificate wrongly. Instead of setting the name of
          the issuer to the subject of the following certificate in the chain,
          it set the issuer name of the proxy to the <em>issuer</em> of the 
          following certificate. This made the proxy certificate valid but
          the chain invalid, and caused authentication checks to fail.

          <a href="http://www.astrogrid.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=2668">BZ2668</a>.
          It has been fixed.
