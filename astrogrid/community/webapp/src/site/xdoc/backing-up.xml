      <p>
        To back up the community state completely, you need to takes copies of:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>the community database;</li>
        <li>the user credentials;</li>
        <li>the certificate-authority files;</li>
        <li>the database-configuration files;</li>
        <li>the context file.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If you installed the community with the standard layout of
        directories then all these files are stored in one tree and may be
        backed up with one <i>tar</i> or <i>zip</i> command.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you want to back up the community database and user credentials
        independently you may use the back-up command on the community menu.
        This will deliver to your browser a zip file containing those data.
        The database contents can only be included if your are using the
        default HSQL database; if you use a differnt, external database then
        the zip file only contains the user user credentials.
