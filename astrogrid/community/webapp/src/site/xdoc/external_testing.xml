      <p>
        For external tests the best thing to do is try to login either via the portal or workbench.  You may have to wait up a certain amount of time before this is possible.  When you did a self-register of the registry metadata this data may (or most likely) have been put in a
         different registry than what the portal or workbench is connected to, and requires "harvesting" to take place which happens at certain intervals (usually every 1 or 2 hours) this will sync up all the registries.
