      <p>
        If you followed the standard procedure for installing the
        community, and used the standard directory layout then you
        have community software in inside Tomcat and community
        configuration under <i>/astrogrid/community</i>.
        The software can be deinstalled by undeploying the web application
        using Tomcat's manager page. The other files can simply be deleted
        from disc.
