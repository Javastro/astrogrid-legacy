    <p>
      Your community web-application contains code to operate a local 
      certificate authority (CA). If, when setting up the community, you chose to
      generate and install the CA credentials, then you can now issue
      identity certificates to members of your community. If you didn't
      install the CA credentials then members of your community will have to
      get their certificates elsewhere; this is a reasonable choice if it is
      easy for them to get national-level certificates. 
    </p>
    <p>
      To issue certificates, you need to enable the CA by giving the
      password that unlocks the CA's credentials. You set this password when you
      generated those credentials, and the system does not remember it from the
      installation. Once you have enabled the CA, the system retains the unlocked
      credentials until you close your web-browser. You can enable the CA using
      the command in the administration menu.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the CA enabled, go to the accounts page in the administration menu.
      For each account there is a button (on the extreme right; it may be
      scrolled off the screen) labelled "Issue ID certificate". Pressing this
      generates the long-term certificate for the account. You need to do this
      for each member of your community as their account is added. If you
      have upgraded the community software from a version that did not support
      the the comunity CA, then you can generate the credentials now for all the
      existing users.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you were to issue new credentials to a user who already has a
      community certificate then trhey would get a new certificate with the
      same formal name. This is probably harmless.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you issue a community certificate, it is a long-term certificate,
      valid for a year. This certificate is passed to the MyProxy service
      accompanying your community web-application and stored there. When the
      certificate owner asks the MyProxy service for credentials, that service
      generates a short-term "proxy" certificate using the stored, long-term
      certificate and returns that. There is no way for a user to extract his
      long-term community certificate from the community, nor shall there be.
      The point of the community CA is to hide from users the process of getting
      and managing long-term certificates. Please note that this is a
      different approach to that used with external, national-level certificates.
