      <p>
        Normal installation is as follows.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Community files owned by the root account.</li>
        <li>Tomcat 5.5.x as the web server, run under the root account, 
            using ports 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS).</li>
        <li>User credentials issued by a community certificate-authority (CA).</li>
        <li>A prescribed directory-structure of configuration, database, CA and 
            user-credential files, stored outside the Tomcat installation.</li>
        <li>No connection with MyProxy.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        That arranagement is documented in these pages. Other approaches are
        possible, at your own risk. Please contact AstroGrid before trying 
        anything unusual; we may be able to help you past the difficulties.
      </p>
      <p>
        The standard procedure for installation follows.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li><a href="standard-tomcat.html">Install and configure Tomcat.</a></li>
        <li><a href="standard-directories.html">Create the directory structure.</a>
            (<a href="variant-directories.html">variants</a>)</li>
        <li><a href="standard-db.html">Install the database.</a></li>
        <li><a href="standard-ca.html">Install the certificate authority.</a></li>
        <li><a href="standard-context.html">Generate the context file.</a></li>
        <li><a href="standard-webapp.html">Install the web application with its context file.</a></li>
        <li>Run the self-tests. (See the main menu in the installed community.)</li>
        <li>Register the community in the IVO registry. (See the main menu in the installed community.)</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        In this sequence, all the configuration is set before the web application
        is installed; there is nothing to tune afterwards. If you find that the
        configuration isn't quite right then the best way to fix it is to
        remove the web application, edit the configuration files and reinstall
        the web application.
