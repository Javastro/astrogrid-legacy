      <p>
        V2008.2.01 fixes some defects that make it hard to set up a new community.
        Deployers with working communities need not upgrade to this version.
      </p>
      <p>
        In v2008.2, the example document for database configuration was
        out of date: it did not include the structural changes needed to work
        with Castor v1.0+ and had an obsolete URL for its DTD. These matters
        are fixed in the current release.
      </p>
      <p>
        In V2008.2, the administration control to initialize the database is
        broken and cannot be used at all, making it impossible to set up a
        new community. This is fixed in the current release.
