      <p>
        If you followed the standard procedure for installing the
        community, and used the standard directory layout then you
        have community software in inside Tomcat and community
        configuration under <i>/astrogrid/community</i>. To upgrade
        the software, first undeploy the web application using Tomcat's
        manager page, then 
        <a href="standard-webapp.html">reinstall the web-application</a>
        using the old, saved <a href="standard-context">context-file</a>.
        The new software will then use the old configuration, database and
        user-credentials.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the
        previous version was 2008.1.02 or older, then you must change the
        structure of your database-configuration file to suit the current
        software (this change is forced on us by changes in 3rd-party software).
        Please see the
        <a href="release-notes-2008.2.a01.html">release notes for Community v2008.2.a01</a>
        for instructions, and the example configuration as a guide.
        If you have successfuly run a community with any version of the web
        application from 2008.2.a01 onward, then your current
        database-configuration file is structurally correct.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before upgrading, please read the release notes to see if you need
        to change anything in your configuration.
