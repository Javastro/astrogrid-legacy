      <subsection name="Version 3 of accounts protocol">
        <p>

      <subsection name="Revision to configuration of community database">
        <p>
          This version of the community web-application uses Castor v1.2, 
          an upgrade from v0.9.5 using in Community 2008.1. The upgrade entrains
          a small change to the XML configuration of the community database.
        </p>
        <p>
          Two changes are needed to existing configurations:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Wrap the <i>database</i> element in a <i>jdo-conf</i> element;</li>
          <li>add a <i>transaction-demarcation</i> element with 
          attribute <i>mode="local"</i> as a child of the <i>jdo-conf</i>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The sample configuration in the web application has already been altered
          to suit.
        </p>
      </subsection>
      
      <subsection name="Bug fix: encoding of passwords">
        <p>
          V2008.1.01 and earlier had a serious problem in the handling of
          passwords: see 
          <a href="http://www.astrogrid.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=2809">bugzilla</a>
          for details. That problem is fixed in this new release.
        </p>
      </subsection>
      
      <subsection name="Refactoring">
        <p>
          The code for the password handling and database configuration has been
          refactored into a smaller set of classes. More unit tests have been
          written. This should, ultimately, improve the reliability of the
          community, but for now, operators should stay alert for problems with
          passwords.
