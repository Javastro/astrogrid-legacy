    <section name="Standard form of the context file">
      <p>
        The community web-application needs to be told where to find
        various files and external services. When using Tomcat, you do this 
        by preparing an XML configuration-file listing <i>environment entries</i>.
        This is known as the <i>context file</i>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Download the sample context-file ("service context" in the templates
        menu of this page).
        You will have to edit some of the values to suit your installation.
      </p>
      <p>
        These entries have to be set specifically for your registry, even if
        you are using the standard installation.
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt>org.astrogrid.community.ident</dt>
        <dd>The formal name of the community. This is the registry identifier
        ("IVORN") of the community with the ivo:// prefix stripped off.</dd>
        <dt>org.astrogrid.vosi.baseurl</dt>
        <dd>The URL at which you installed the web-application. This is the URL
        leading to the web-application's front page. This affects the
        registration of the community.</dd>
        <dt>org.astrogrid.vosi.baseurlsecure</dt>
        <dd>The same as <i>org.astrogrid.community.baseurl</i>, but for HTTPS.</dd>
        <dt>org.astrogrid.community.default.vospace</dt>
        <dd>The registry identifier ("IVORN") for the VOSpace service associated
        with the community.</dd>
      </dl>  
      <p>
        These entries are already correct for your community if you are
        following the standard installation. You may need to change them if
        you change the installation details.
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt>org.astrogrid.registry.query.endpoint</dt>
        <dd>The URL for the web service for queries to the full registry. (Given
          value is for a registry run by AstroGrid in the UK; you might want
          to use a local registry.)</dd>
        <dt>org.astrogrid.registry.query.alt.endpoint</dt>
        <dd>The URL for the web service for queries to the back-up full-registry.
         (Given
          value is for a registry run by AstroGrid in the UK; you might want
          to use a local registry.)</dd>
        <dt>org.astrogrid.community.dbconfigurl</dt>
        <dd>The URL for the main database-configuration file (should begin with 
        <i>file:</i>).</dd>
        <dt>org.astrogrid.community.myproxy</dt>
        <dd>The directory in which the community keeps its user credentials.
         (so named because the MyProxy server shares this directory when present;
         you still need this value even if you do not run MyProxy).</dd>
        <dt>org.astrogrid.community.cakey</dt>
        <dd>The file holding the CA's private key (always a <i>.pem</i> file.</dd>
        <dt>org.astrogrid.community.cacert</dt>
        <dd>The file holding the CA's root certificate (always a <i>.pem</i> file.</dd>
        <dt>org.astrogrid.community.caserial</dt>
        <dd>The file holding the CA's record of certificate serial-numbers.</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        Having made the context file, put a copy somewhere safe, where it will be
        backed up. In the standard directory-layout, 
        <i>/astrogrid/community/context.xml</i> is the best place. Storing a
        copy here does not actually apply the settings; that is done when the
        web application is deployed into Tomcat.
