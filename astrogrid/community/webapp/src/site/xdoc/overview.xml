       <p>
         The community software provides a means to register IVO users, and
         to provide them with credentials so that they can access restricted
         resources. The community is supplied as a web application that
         provides a number of services.
       </p>
     <dl>
       <dt>Accounts service:</dt>
       <dd>a RESTful web-service that dispenses credentials and reveals the
           URL for a user's home space in VOSpace.</dd>
       <dt>Policy manager:</dt>
       <dd>a SOAP service which reports to the client the IVORN for the user's
       home space.</dd>
       <dd>This is service is deprecated, its role being taken over by the
           accounts service. Clients using this service should switch to
           the accounts service immediately, as the policy manager will
           be removed in later releases.</dd>
       <dt>Administration interface:</dt>
       <dd>a classical web-browser interface for the community operators.</dd>
     </dl>
     
     <p>
       The community contains a local certificate authority, operated by the
       community managers through the community's administration interface.
