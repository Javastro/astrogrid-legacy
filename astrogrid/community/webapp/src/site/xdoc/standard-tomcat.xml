    <section name="Standard Configuration of Apache Tomcat">
      <p>
        Use Apache Tomcat 5.5.x. Version 2008.2.01 of the community web-application
        was tested with Tomcat 5.5.26.
      </p>
      <p>
        The root account should run the Tomcat installation and own all its files.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tomcat should provide HTTP service on port 80 and HTTPS service on
        port 443. These ports are specified in Tomcat's <i>conf/server.xml</i> 
        file, in <i>Connector</i> elements; edit the file if they are not already
        correct.
        The default configuration in the downloaded Tomcat usually has the correct
        connectors but on different ports: change HTTP from port 8080 to 80 and
        HTTPS from port 8443 to 443 if necessary. Uncomment the declaration of
        the HTTPS connector if it is commented out.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ensure that you can get to Tomcat's manager page; that page is linked
        from Tomcat's home page. To view the manager you need a user name,
        password and role in <i>conf/tomcat-users.xml</i>. See Tomcat's own
        documents for details. You need to use the manager page to deploy
        the community.
      </p>
      <p>
        Configure HTTPS with credentials for the host running Tomcat, following
        Tomcat's normal procedure. Self-signed credentials are sufficient for
        the current release, but later upgrades might require you to get
        credentials from a recognised certificate-authority. You need the
        credentials to make HTTPS work, and you need HTTPS to run the
        community accounts service. There are some 
        <a href="host-certificate.html">notes on generating
        self-signed certificates</a> since Tomcat's description of the process is
        incomplete.
      </p>
      <p>
        Set Tomcat to start whenever the host machine reboots. The procedure
        for this depends on the operating system, but generally requires you
        to write a short shell-script. In this script, you may pass parameters
        to the JVM that runs Tomcat. AstroGrid recommends these settings, which
        are based on the SUN JVM.
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt>-server</dt>
        <dd>Use the server version of the JVM.</dd>
        <dt>-Xmx750m</dt>
        <dd>Allow 750MB of heap space.</dd>
        <dt>-XX:MaxPermSize=256m</dt>
        <dd>Allow 256MB of "permanent generation" space (the default is
        64MB which is too low).</dd>
        <dt>-Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true"</dt>
        <dd>Avoids IPv6 connections which give problems when the
        intervening network is not completely suitable for IPV6.</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        Run Tomcat with Java 5. The SUN JDK/JRE 1.5.0 is preferred.
