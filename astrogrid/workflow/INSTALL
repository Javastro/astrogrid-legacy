1.0 SOFTWARE PREREQUISITES:
*****************************

1.1 Externals.
----------------

These are the environments under which JES was developed:
. RedHat Linux 8
. Java sdk j2sdk1.4.1_02
. Tomcat 4.1.24


1.2 The  astrogrid-portal-workflow.War file
--------------------------------------------

Contains all the runtime files required for workflow apart from the external prerequisites.


2.0 Deploying the War file:
****************************
Note: the astrogrid portal is designed to accept pluggable components, workflow is one such component.
Before workflow can be installed the astrogrid-portal must be installed and working.
Copy the astrogrid-portal-workflow war file into the Tomcat webapps directory. Unjar this
war file, creating the following directory structure under the webapps directory...

astrogrid-portal-workflow
  |
  +__mount
  |
  +__WEB-INF
      |
      +__classes
      |
      +__lib
      
      
The astrogrid-portal-workflow directory (or similarly named) will contain contain the following important file:
ASTROGRID_workflowconfig.xml    - the workflow configuration file

The configuration file needs to be altered or merged with any already existing JES configuration file
before being moved into the WEB-INF/classes directory. See the README for extra details on this step.
