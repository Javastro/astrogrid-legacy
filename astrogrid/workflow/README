1.0 SOFTWARE PREREQUISITES:
*****************************

1.1 Externals.
----------------
These are the environments under which Workflow was developed:
. RedHat Linux 8
. Java sdk j2sdk1.4.1_02
. Tomcat 4.1.24
. Axis-1_1RC2


1.2 Internals.
----------------
Two important software prerequisites are the workflow's two properties files:

(1) The configuration file ASTROGRID_workflowconfig.properties. A great deal
of setup-configurable data is held here. The file is well commented and bears
reading... <<<MUST>>> be read!

(2) The workflow messages file ASTROGRID_workflowmessages.properties.
All messages issued by workflow are detailed here.


1.2.1 The astrogrid-portal-workflow Configuration File and associated files
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The workflow configuration file is named ASTROGRID_workflowconfig.xml.
There are some files associated with it, one containing application
messages, and others used as templates for xml by the workflow system (to follow).
All apart from the configuration file are automatically copied to 
a suitable classpath location. The configuration file requires
editing, and possibly merging with a previous config file if this is
not a first install.

1.2 Editing the config file.
-------------------------------
The config file is broken down into certain categories:
GENERAL       do not edit
MESSAGES      do not edit
WORKFLOW      editable with caution
MYSPACE       editable
JES           editable
TOOLS         editable
QueryTool     editable with caution
VOTableMerge  editable with caution
Sextractor    editable with caution
HyperZ        editable with caution


1.2.1 WORKFLOW 
----------------
Do not change the parser validation value from "false".

1.2.2 MYSPACE
---------------
CACHE_DIRECTORY: Local directory where temporary files associated with the MySpace facility can be created
The url value identifies the myspace web service. This must be set accurately to the
web service end point...
http://$HOST_DNS_NAME:8080/axis/services/MySpaceManager 
Alter $HOST_DNS_NAME to reflect the deployed service for your installation.

1.2.1 JES Category
----------------------
Edit the ID value to uniquely name this JES installation. This value is used extensively
so choose a sensible value and stick with it.

1.2.2 TOOLS Category
------------------------------
This is a list of tools available for use in creating a workflow. At present there are 4 tools available:
. QueryTool
. VOTableMerge
. Sextractor
. HyperZ

1.3 Locate the Config File.
-----------------------------
The config file needs to be located on the workflow application class path. Copy it 
into the $CATALINA_HOME/webapps/$WORKFLOW_HOME/WEB-INF/classes directory, where...
$CATALINA_HOME is the Tomcat install directory
$WORKFLOW_HOME is the workflow application install directory



The workflow package will not work without these files being available. 

Other prerequisites are included with the distribution. 
See section 4.0 Install below.


2.0 PORTAL:
****************

2.1 Overview of PORTAL.         
----------------------------
The portal has been designed as a framework into which components, such as workflow, can be deployed. 

**** IMPORTANT ****

Prior to installing workflow the astrogid-portal.war must have been successfully installed.


3.0 LIMITATIONS:
******************

Each workflow is created using 1 of 4 available templates. These templates:
. oneStepSequenceTemplate
. twoStepSequenceTemplate
. twoStepFlowTemplate
. twoStepFlowAndMergeTemplate

are currently held within Workflow.java, it is intended to move these to configuration files, to enable
new workflow templates to be created and included.


4.0 INSTALL:
**************

4.1 Unjar the astrogrid-portal-workflow.war archive.
-------------------------------------
Unjar to the webapps directory of your $CATALINA install. The archive contains the following:

. This README, so presumably you have already got this far!
. ASTROGRID_workflowconfig.xml
. ASTROGRID_workflowmessages.properties

4.2 Make sure the external prerequisites are fullfilled.
----------------------------------------------------------
See section 1.1


4.3 Copy config files into appropriate classpath location for Tomcat.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Suggest the best location is the $CATALINA_HOME/common/classes directory, but any 
convenient place where they can be picked up as part of a classpath should be OK.


4.4 READ THE WORKFLOW CONFIGURATION PROPERTIES FILE.
-------------------------------------------------------
Look in the config directory.

Note: Tools available for use within workflow are configured in ASTROGRID_workflowconfig.xml.
At present these include:
.QueryTool
.DataFederation
.SExtractor
.HyperZ

Any additional tools you wish to add should be configured here.
ASTROGRID_workflowconfig.xml also contains the URLs for both the MySpace and JES systems.

4.5 Alter the workflow configuration file.
----------------------------------------------


4.6 Ensure Tomcat is running.
---------------------------------------------------
You may have to restart Tomcat after step 4.3
Login in to the portal as usual (http://localhost:8080/cocoon/astrogrid-portal/),
a worklow menu option should now be visible.


4.7 You are ready to go!
-------------------------
