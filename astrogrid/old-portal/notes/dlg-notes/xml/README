This directory contains 
- schema - mostly copied from other places and fixed up to be acceptable to XMLSpy and associated tools. These fixes will only be important if/when the xml is properly validated
- style sheets - to generate HTML to match the mock-up html pages (in ../html) from XML responses
- xml files containing some test output believed to be correct from other Web Services
