The Astrogrid test portlet is on the home (anon user) page. This page cannot
be edited to add or remove portlets. The user astrogrid (same password)
exists as an example of a configurable page. This contains BOTH the Registry
portlet and one developed at RAL to invoke the CDS Aladdin applet. Or you 
can create create your OWN username and add portlets in any style and 
number you like. To do this attempt to login with an unknown username and 
a dialog box with the option to "create an account" will appear.

All other source files in this directory are presented for reference only.
An ant build file to use them sensibly will appear soon!
