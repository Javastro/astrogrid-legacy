Deploying the Astrogrid test Portal                              BKM 20030410

1) Install apache tomcat (current version is 4.1.18)

2) Copy Astrogrid.war into $CATALINA_HOME/webapps

3) *Important* If your computer accesses web-pages via a central webcache
    (which you need to configure your web browser to use) you will need
    to also set an environment variable before going further to enable Java
    applets to work. For example at RAL we need to set CATALINA_OPTS
    as follows (all on one line!):
    setenv CATALINA_OPTS -DproxySet=true -DproxyHost=wwwcache.rl.ac.uk
             -DproxyPort=8080 -Dhttp.nonProxyHosts=localhost|*.rl.ac.uk

4) Start tomcat (with CATALINA_OPTS set as above if required)

5) Point browser at http:/<machine name>:8080/Astrogrid

The Astrogrid test portlet is on the home (anon user) page. This page cannot
be edited to add or remove portlets. The user astrogrid (same password)
exists as an example of a configurable page. This contains BOTH the Registry
portlet and one developed at RAL to invoke the CDS Aladin applet. Or you 
can create create your OWN username and add portlets in any style and 
number you like. To do this attempt to login with an unknown username and 
a dialog box with the option to "create an account" will appear.

*Note* The successful use of the CDS Aladdin applet depends upon both the
possible local configuration setting for Tomcat (Stage 3 - above) and the
browser having support for Java applets. This is NOT the case by deault in, at
least, Microsoft Internet Explorer V6. A test would be to try Aladin manually
via the URL http://aladin.u-strasbg.fr/aladin.gml

All other source files in this directory are presented for reference only.
An ant build file to use them sensibly will appear soon!

Revision History:

   Astrogrid.war file revised to correct a reported bug whereby entering a
   different port number to the default (8080) was ignored.
   Better formatting of the XML registry results.
   Revised README (this file)
