There are three files to add to Jetpeed as follows:

   $JPORTAL/webapp/WEB-INF/templates/jsp/portlets/html/AstrogridRegistry.jsp
   $JPORTAL/src/java/org/astrogrid/registry/actions/portlets/AstroGridRegistryAction.java
   $JPORTAL/webapp/WEB-INF/conf/Astrogrid.xreg

Where $JPORTAL is the Jportal Home directory.

You will also need the following class libraries:

   uk.ac.starlink.jscp  contained in 'jadamclasses.jar'
   org.apache.axis  contained in 'axis.jar'
   javax.xml contained in 'jaxrpc.jar'

These jar files should be put in $CATALINA_HOME/webapps/jportal/WEB-INF/lib where $CATALINA_HOME is the
Tomcat home directory.

From $JPORTAL type 'ant deploy or ant hotdeploy' to compile the java files a put them
into the production system.
