	The  FIRST survey to produce  Faint Images of the  Radio Sky at Twenty
    centimeters began in 1993. It  uses  the  VLA  (Very  Large  Array,  a
    facility  of the  National Radio Observatory (NRAO)) at a frequency of
    1.4GHz,  and it is slated  to 10,000 deg2 to  a sensitivity of about
    1mJy with  an angular resolution of about  5". The co-added images are
    available  on   the   Internet   (see   the   FIRST   home   page   at
    http://sundog.stsci.edu/ for details). The source catalogue is derived
    from the images.

    This version of the FIRST Survey is derived from the 1993 through 1998
    observations,   and contains  549,707 sources  covering the  north and
    south  Galactic caps.  The catalog covers about a total of 6060 square
    degrees of sky (5450 square  degrees  in  the  north  and  610  square
    degrees in the south).

    No  new data were taken for the  south Galactic cap from the preceding
    version (catalog VIII/51), but the southern images south of about -2
    degrees  were  reprocessed  with  an  improved  pipeline  script  that
    substantially  reduces the sidelobe levels in  a small fraction of the
    fields. Consequently, many of the southern sources have slight changes
    in their  positions,  flux densities,  and  other properties;  a small
    number  of sources  from the  previous catalog  are missing  from this
    catalog.
