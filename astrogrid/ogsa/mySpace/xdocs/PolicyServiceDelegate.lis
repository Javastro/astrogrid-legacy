  Including a Real of Fake PolicyServiceDelegate in the MySpace System
  ====================================================================

Introduction
------------

The MySpace Manager needs to check whether the user is permitted to
perform the operations which he is attempting.  It makes such checks by
creating a PolicyServiceDelegate object and invoking methods of this
object which carry out the checks required.  A real
PolicyServiceDelegate object works by using Web services to submit
queries to a remote policy server.  This arrangement potentially posses
difficulties whilst the MySpace Manager (or MySpace system) is being
tested and de-bugged.  Specifically:

* the de-bug or test program must be set up for sending Web service
  queries to the remote policy server,

* the remote policy server must be up and running,

* any user's details included in the test program must pertain to real
  users known to the policy server.

In order to circumvent these problems the MySpace source code includes a
fake PolicyServiceDelegate.  This fake class contains a method for
checking whether a user is authorised to perform a given task which is
simply hard-coded to always return `true'.  Thus, testing of the MySpace
system can proceed without having to worry about invoking Web services.
The constructor for the fake PolicyServiceDelegate prints the following
line to standard output when it is invoked:

  Created fake PolicyServiceDelegate.

and thus it should always be possible to tell whether a real or fake
PolicyServiceDelegate is being used.

The remainder of this note explains how to control whether real of fake
PolicyServiceDelegate objects to be created by the MySpace system.


Real PolicyServiceDelegate
--------------------------

In order to use real PolicyServiceDelegate objects in the MySpace system
two jar files need to be obtained from the portalB sub-directory of the
AstroGrid CVS repository.  The full paths and names of these files are:

  .../astrogrid/portalB/depends/community/authentication-client-1.0.jar
  .../astrogrid/portalB/depends/community/policy-client-1.0.jar

Having retrieved copies of these jar files you then need to ensure that
they are included in your CLASSPATH.  In order to ensure that the real
PolicyServiceDelegate objects are picked up in preference to the fake
ones (below) the jar files should occur in your CLASSPATH before the
entry for the MySpace source tree.  (I'm unsure whether a MySpace
release is supposed to include its own copies of these jar files, but if
so they should probably live in:

  .../astrogrid/mySpace/lib

Currently I keep my copies in a directory outside the AstroGrid tree.)


Fake PolicyServiceDelegate
--------------------------

The source code for the fake PolicyServiceDelegate class is included in
the MySpace source tree.  Thus, the fake objects will be automatically
included in a MySpace system unless you have the jar files for the real
classes (above) included in your CLASSPATH before the entry for the
MySpace tree.  There are actually two fake classes; their full names and
paths are:

  .../astrogrid/mySpace/src/java/org/astrogrid/community/common/util/
                                                     CommunityMessage.java
  .../astrogrid/mySpace/src/java/org/astrogrid/community/delegate/policy/
                                                PolicyServiceDelegate.java

You will need to ensure that these classes are compiled.



Thus, in either case, the trick is to ensure that the correct version of
the class is picked up, which is basically controlled by whether the jar
files for the real classes are included in your CLASSPATH before the
entry for the MySpace source tree.
