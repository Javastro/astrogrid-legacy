Introduction
------------

This document is the release note for the AstroGrid Iteration 2 mySpace
system.  MySpace is a component of the AstroGrid software.  It provides
AstroGrid users with access to geographically distributed scratch space.
Its primary use is to store the results of queries submitted to
astronomical databases by the AstroGrid system.  In Iteration 2 mySpace
can only be used to store files (typically containing VOTables).  In
future iterations it might also be possible to store database tables.
Because of this mooted extension the entities which mySpace stores
are referred to using the generic name `dataHolders', rather than simply
being called `files.'  The mySpace system presents the user with a
hierarchical view of his dataHolders, organising them into `containers',
which are analogous to operating system directories or folders.

MySpace is a component of the AstroGrid system.  It is not directly
exposed to the user.  Rather, a user browses and interacts with his
mySpace entries using the mySpace Explorer, another component of the
Astrogrid system.  Other components of the system, such as the Data
Agent and the Job Control, insert dataHolders into the mySpace system.

This note gives an overview of the mySpace system and lists its
assumptions, functionality, restrictions and known bugs.  It does not
contain installation instructions; separate installation instructions
are provided elsewhere.


Overview
--------

MySpace is a distributed system.  The AstroGrid system could contain
several mySpace systems.  Every mySpace system consists of a mySpace
Manager and one or more mySpace Servers.  These components can be
geographically dispersed.  They communicate via Web services.  The
mySpace Servers are simply repositories for storing dataHolders (ie.
files) and have little local intelligence.  Conversely, the mySpace
Manager keeps track of the dataHolders known to the mySpace system:
what dataHolders are stored, who owns them, when they were created etc.
To store these data the mySpace Manager maintains a `registry', which
is just a big list of all the dataHolders in the mySpace system.  This
mySpace registry has little in common with the AstroGrid resource
registry; the information stored in the mySpace registry for each
dataHolder is both fixed and limited (see the Section `Information
Stored in the MySpace Registry').

In addition to using Web services internally to communicate between
its components, mySpace is also invoked, by other components in the
AstroGrid system, using Web servces.

The mySpace Manager can be invoked to perform a number of discrete
actions or tasks, each corresponding to some operation on the mySpace
system.  These actions are briefly listed in the Section `Functions
Supported', below.

Iteration 2 includes the first version of the mySpace system.  Numerous
features are either not implemented or half-implemented (ie. some of
the `hooks' needed to implement a feature have been implemented, but
the full, working feature is not available).  Many of these deficiencies
and restrictions are listed in the Section `Restrictions', below.


Assumptions
-----------

MySpace is part of the AstroGrid system and is assumed to be deployed
as part of the AstroGrid software.  Deploying it in isolation does not
make sense.  In particular, a mySpace Explorer is required to browse
the contents a mySpace system.

Various external components commonly required by the AstroGrid software,
such as Apache/Tomcat, are assumed to be available.  The Iteration 2
mySpace does not require any external components not otherwise used
by AstroGrid.

The host operating system is assumed to be Linux (though most, if not
all, of the components would probably work on many other variants of
Unix).


Functions Supported
-------------------

The mySpace manager can be invoked to perform the following actions.

* Look up the details of a single dataHolder.
* Look up the details of a set of dataHolders, selected by their names
  matching a wild-carded query.
* Create a container.
* Import a dataHolder.
* Copy a dataHolder.
* Move a dataHolder.
* Export a dataHolder.
* Delete a dataHolder or container.


Information Stored in the MySpace Registry
------------------------------------------

Every entry in the mySpace registry corresponds to a dataHolder or
container.  The following information is stored for each entry.

* The full name of the dataHolder (including its full container
  hierarchy).
* A unique numeric identifier for the dataHolder (used internally
  to refer to it).
* The name of the server file corresponding to the dataHolder.
* The user identifier of the user who owns the dataHolder.
* The creation date.
* The expiry date.
* The size of the dataHolder in bytes.
* The type of the dataHolder (with codes for VOTable and container;
  additional codes will probably be required in the future).
* The access permissions mask for the dataHolder.


Restrictions and Limitations
----------------------------

The Iteration 2 mySpace has the following restrictions and limitations.
We anticipate that many of these restrictions will be addressed in
future iterations.

* The mySpace Server(s) must be located on the same machine as the
  Data Agent, Job Control or whichever software is importing dataHolders
  into the mySpace system.

* MySpace cannot copy dataHolders between different servers in the
  same mySpace system.

* Exporting dataHolders is implementing by returning a URL to whatever
  software is invoking the mySpace system (usually the mySpace
  Explorer).  This software can then use the URL to retrieve a copy of
  the dataHolder.  This approach might or might not be a kludge.

* There is no user authentication.

* There is no user authorisation and checking of requested operations
  against permissions masks.  Any user can perform any operation.

* An expiry period is implemented in the sense of being computed
  when a dataHolder is created and stored, along with the dataHolder's
  other details, in the registry.  However, there is no action to check
  for expired dataHolders and take some action.  Indeed, it is not
  clear what action is required and how configurable it should be.

* There are no `system administrator' actions to, for example, reconcile
  the entries in the registry with the files actually present on the
  servers.  Such actions would be useful, for example, for discovering
  and recovering from misadventures.

* New users can only be introduced when the registry is created, ie.
  when the mySpace system is installed.

* There are no user disk quotas on the servers.

* The registry is implemented as a file rather than a DBMS.  Moreover,
  this file is read and re-written every time the mySpace Manager
  performs an action.  This behaviour is ok for a small registry but
  might become unacceptably slow for a large registry.

* DataHolders in the registry are identified by a unique integer
  sequence number.  The sequence used starts at 0 for the first entry
  and is incremented for every new entry added.  There is no facility
  to re-use numbers as entries are deleted.  Eventually the system
  will crash when the number becomes too large for a four-byte integer.

* A very limited range of queries on the dataHolder name are supported:
  just a wild-card (`*') at the end of of the query.  Some additional
  options required include:

  - options for a terminating wild-card to show just the entries in
    the trailing container (`*') or to include all entries in any
    child containers (`**'),

  - embedded wild-cards (ie. not at the end of the name),

  - perhaps Unix-like regular expressions.

* The names of selected dataHolders and containers are returned as a
  flat list.  It might be preferable to return them as a hierarchy
  of containers.

* The system could potentially be extended to include database tables
  in addition to operating system files.


Known Bugs
----------

None extant.
