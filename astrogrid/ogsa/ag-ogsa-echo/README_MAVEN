This project comes with a comprehensive set of ant build 
tasks.  

At the moment, it's possible to build the source (but not 
deploy the resulting grid service, which requires additional 
infrastructure) using the command "maven antBuild" (a custom
maven goal which simply delegates the build to ant).

At present, a Globus 3.0 installation is also required in
order to build the source successfully, and the files 
build.xml and config/build.properties need to be configured
to reflect the location of this installation.  

If somebody can tell me (kea@ast.cam.ac.uk) how to get Maven 
to pass its maven.dependency.classpath to ant, we should be able 
to eliminate the explicit Globus 3.0 dependency (for building
the source, but not deploying it of course!).
