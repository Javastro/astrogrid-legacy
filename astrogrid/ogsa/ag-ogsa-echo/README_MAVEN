This project comes with a comprehensive set of ant build 
tasks.  

At the moment, it's possible to build the source (but not 
deploy the resulting grid service, which requires additional 
infrastructure) using the command "maven jar" (a customised
maven goal which simply delegates the build to ant).

To actually use the service, a Globus 3.0 installation is 
required.  The ant build.xml file contains targets for deploying
to and from a Tomcat server enabled with OGSA.
In order to deploy successfully, the build.xml and config/build.properties 
files need to be configured to reflect the location and configuration
of this ogsa/tomcat installation.  

NOTE: The maven build uses dependences from Globus 3.0.  Attempting
to deploy a service built using maven and its dependency jars to
any earlier or later major/minor Globus release may not work.

NOTE:  The "ant deploy" target (for deployment with a standalone OGSA
container) is a legacy target and no longer supported.  We recommend
deployment via Tomcat.
