<h1>AstroGrid FileStore Installer</h1>
Version @VERSION@.   Built @NOW@.
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<br>
This software will download and install the AstroGrid FileStore component.<br>
FileStore and FileManager together make the AstroGrid MySpace distributed storage system - 
for information on this and other AstroGrid components see the
software site <a href="http://software.astrogrid.org">http://software.astrogrid.org</a>.
<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<ol>
  <li>A target machine running Tomcat 5.0 or higher, with the Manager
webapp enabled</li>
  <li>Username and password for the Manager webapp</li>
  <li>(Optional) An AstroGrid Registry (for
example: <tt>http://hydra.star.le.ac.uk:8080/astrogrid-registry</tt>
)</li>
  <li>Java jdk 1.4 (probably present if you are reading this!)</li>
  <li>A connection to the internet if this is the first time you have run the installer</li>
</ol>
<h2>Installation</h2>
This installer will guide you through the installation process, downloading any necessary software and
prompting you for configuration options.  If you have previously installed FileStore, you can use the installer
to remove this instance, reinstall it, or register it.  
<br>
<b>Important Note</b><br>
If you are installing a FileStore that is to be used and registered externally to the target machine you MUST
replace the Tomcat URL of "http://127.0.0.1:8080" with the full externally visible URL when prompted.

<h2>Installing from behind a proxy/firewall</h2>
The installer attempts to download any files it needs from the AstroGrid repository.  If you are behind a firewall or use an internet proxy cache
see <a href="http://www.astrogrid.org/maven/docs/HEAD/installers.html">Firewalls/proxies</a>.
<h2>Install offline</h2>
If you have previously run the installer and downloaded the necessary files to your local disk, then you can rerun the installer in offline mode by passing the offline=true properties to the installer<br>
    <tt>java -jar (installer.jar) -Doffline=true</tt><br>
Other useful properties you can override on the commandline are:
<ul>
    <li><tt>maven.local.repo=${user.home}/.maven/repository</tt> location for the installer to download files</li>
    <li><tt>filestore.war.name=astrogrid-filestore-${version}.war</tt> the name of the war file to install</li>
    
</ul>
