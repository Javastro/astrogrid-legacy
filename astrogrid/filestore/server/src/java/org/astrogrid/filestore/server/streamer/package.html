        <h1>Secured streaming of files to web browsers</h1>
        
        <p>
            This package provides a secured file-streaming servlet that can stream any file visible to a 
            filestore server while respecting the filestore's access controls. {@link StreamServlet} is the
            servlet itself. {@link StreamTicket}, {@link StreamTicketList} and {@link StreamTicketException}
            are the API by which a filestore web-service can authorize the servlet to stream certain files.
        </p>
        
        <p>When viewing files in a filestore with a web browser, a user wants three things:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>a link to click on, which implies that the file is on a server somewhere;</li>
            <li>correct MIME-type information, such the right veiwer can be selected;</li>
            <li>privacy of the files: only authorized users must be able to see the files.</li>
        </ul>
        
         <p>
             Authorization relies on authentication and single-sign-on authentication, 
             as required by AstroGrid, is difficult to achive with web browsers as clients.
             Notably, web browsers cannot use the SOAP security favours for AstroGrid
            services in ordinary downloads.
         </p>
            
         <p>
             In this package, a web-service client authenticates to the filestore web-service
             and asks for a specific file to be made available via HTTP. The service creates
             a {@link StreamTicket} for the file and registers it in a {@link StreamTicketList}.
             All instances of {@link StreamTicketList} inside one JVM share the same list of 
             tickets, so the streaming servlet can read back the tickets from its own
             StreamTicketList. The service returns a URL to the client with the name of the
             ticket embedded.
         </p>
            
         <p>
             The web-service client passes the URL to a browser. When the browser is 
             sent to that URL,  the request passes to the streaming servlet. The servlet
             identifies the ticket from the name embedded in the URL. If the named ticket is
             not in the {@StreamTicketList}, then the servlet refuses the request. If the ticket
             is present, then the servlet removes the ticket from the list and streams the file.
         </p>
            
         <p>
             The ticket names are random and obscure; therefore, they are effectively secrets,
             provided that the client software does not expose them on public web pages.
             The ticket names are thus used as single-use passwords.
         </p>
