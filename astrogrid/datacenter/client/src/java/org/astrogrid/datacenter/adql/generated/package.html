Query Object Model for AQDL queries.
Top level class is {@link org.astrogrid.datacenter.adql.Select}
<p>
All classes provide methods to marshall to XML, marshall from XML and validate object against constraints of corresponding XML schema. 
These are defined in the {@link org.astrogrid.datacenter.adql.QOM} interface.
<p>
Generated by Castor from the ADQL xml schema.
Ignored the <tt>*Descriptor</tt> classes - they are used within the Castor implementation only.
<p>
<b>NB</b> - this package requires the castor-xml jar on classpath, and <i>also</i> the xerces.jar . Any other xml parser wont't do - 
 castor uses other classes from xerces.
 @todo - update to released version of ADQLSchema.xsd - seems to tidy up some of the loose ends of existing schema
 and adds better searching / expressions - e.g. trig functions.
