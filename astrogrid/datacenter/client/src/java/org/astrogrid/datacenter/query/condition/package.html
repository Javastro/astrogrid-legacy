A set of classes for modelling conditions - such as those in a SQL WHERE clause,
or a java language 'if' statement, or any other search criteria.
<p>
The class diagram is very different from the ownership diagram to make sure we
have only correclty typed structures. For example, a LogicalExpression is
made up of Conditions and is itself a Condition.  A NumericalComparison is made
up of NumericExpressions (and operators) and is itself a Condition.

Er... Could probably do with some diagrams here...
