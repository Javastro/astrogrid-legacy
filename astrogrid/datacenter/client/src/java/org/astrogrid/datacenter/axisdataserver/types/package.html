		<h1>SOAP-y Beans</h1>
		This package contains data beans that are transported via SOAP between client and server.
		The sources are generated from the wsdl and xsd files by the <tt>wsdl2java</tt> tool.
		Most important is the {@link org.astrogrid.datacenter.axisdataserver.types._query} class, which 
		encapuslates a query to the server.
