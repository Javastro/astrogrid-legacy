		<h1>Server stub and Skeleton</h1>
		This package contains the SOAP stubs and skeletons generated by the <tt>wsdl2java</tt>
		tool. The input to this tool are the <tt>AxisDataServer.wsdl</tt> and <tt>AxisDataServer.xsd</tt> files.
		Edit these files to make changes - do not alter the code directly, as all changes will be lost on the next regenerate.
