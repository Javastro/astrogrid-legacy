<h2>Purpose</h2>
General io classes for help in writing XML documents from code.
<p>
This has two purposes; 1) it helps to write 'correct' XML (eg closing tags etc)
and 2) it could be used to write out to binary form instead....
<p>
I expect it's bad to write out to XML from code, but it's a lot simpler than generating
a load of object models to populate :-)

<h2>Use</h2>

create an XmlOutputStream, then call newTag() to start the first tag, and then newTags on that child tag as required.
