Images for the desktop GUI tools.
<p>There is probably some sensible way of getting these from the look & feel toolkits,
but there are many that are hard to find.  So in any case this directory, along with
the IconFactory, provide a reasonably easy way to get some nice icons for toolbar
buttons when assembling Dialog boxes, etc.
