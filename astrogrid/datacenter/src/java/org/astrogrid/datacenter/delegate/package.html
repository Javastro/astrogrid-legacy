The delegates exist to make calling Astrogrid services as trivial as creating a Delegate instance,
and then calling a method on it.

<h3>Quick Start to Using Datacenter Delegates</h3>

You will need one delegate instance per service you are connecting to.  You can then use that
one delegate to make as many calls to that service as you like.
<p>
<h4>Creating a delegate</h4>
Don't use a delegate constructor to create a delegate, use the call:
<p>
<code><pre>
  DatacenterDelegate delegate = DatacenterDelegate.makeDelegate(String endpoint);
</pre></code>
<p>
This will construct the right Delegate subclass, depending on the server being connected to.
This server type is defined on the client side (ie you, the Delegate user) by the protocol
given in the <b>endpoint</b> parameter which should be 'url'-like:
<blockquote>
  <p> <b>(null)</b> passing a null string creates a dummy delegate that can be used for testing </p>
  <p> <b>http://...</b> connects to a web-service datacenter (ie Apache/Tomcat/Axis server). </p>
  <p> <b>socket://...</b> connects to a socket based datacenter (ie 'pure' TCP/IP dual stream). </p>
   <p> <b>grid://...</b> connects to a grid-service datacenter (eg Globus, not implemented yet) </p>
   <p> <b>direct://...</b> connects to a colocated datacenter (runs on same JVM, not implemented yet) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Note that some datacenters might provide more than one connection type, but this is (presumably?)
information you can find in the registry.
<p>
<h4>Doing a Query</h4>
Call <code>delegate.doQuery(Element query)</code> to carry out a blocking query
on the service. Actually this will take any query; make sure the type is specified
in the surrounding <code>Query</code> tag, eg <code>&lt;Query type='adql'&gt;</code>
 or <code>&lt;Query type='astrogrid'&gt;</code>
<p>
To start an asynchronous query, you first call <code>makeQuery()</code> which returns
a status code and an assigned query id (if it was not provided in the given document).
You can then registerListeners, etc, and when you are ready, start the query using
<code>startQuery()</code>.  Your listeners will be notified when the query is complete,
and you can then call getResultsAndClose() which returns a url of where to find the
results.  NB once this call is made you may not be able to access information on
that query ID 'session' again.
<p>
<h4>Doing other things</h4>
Refer to the DatacenterDelegate methods.

<h3>What you will need</h3>
<p>
You will need the following datacenter packages:
<blockquote>
<pre><code>org.astrogrid.datacenter.delegate
org.astrogrid.datacenter.common
org.astrogrid.datacenter.io</code></pre>
</blockquote>
and the following 3rd party ones:
<p>
<li>RMI/RPC implementation, eg <code>jaxrpc.jar</code>
<li>Axis library (for XMLUtils), ie <code>axis.jar</code>
<li>XML implementation, eg ...
<li>SAX implementation, eg...
<li>...more...

<p>
<h3>A matter of state</h3>

In principle a delegate has 'state', in that it represents the clients view on a single server
for as long as it exists.  However, the WebDelegate uses http to communicate with the server, and
http has no concept of state.
<p>
(Having said this, what we're actually doing is using rpc over http, and there is a 'session'
concept available, but not sure if this works for non-java clients.  To be investigated).
<p>
Most service calls anyway are atomic - a request for information with a response containing that
information or an error.  It is up to the delegate to make sure the response ties in with the
request - to make sure that the delegate is threadsafe (so that if one thread calls a request, and
another does so too before the response returns, the appropriate response is directed to the
appropriate request).  This is done by routing all send/receive pairs through one synchronised
private method.
<p>
What we <i>do</i> have is a query state - it is possible to start a database query, and then request
the status of that query.
<p>
<h3>How they work</h3>

<h4>Web Delegates</h4>

I don't know, ask Noel or Peter about WSDL-generated stubs etc.

<h4>Socket Delegates</h4>
You don't really want to know do you?  Oh alright I'll put stuff in here sometime.

<h4>Grid Delegates</h4>
Nobody knows, not been implemented yet.

<h4>Direct Delegates</h4>
For colocated services; not been implemented yet.
