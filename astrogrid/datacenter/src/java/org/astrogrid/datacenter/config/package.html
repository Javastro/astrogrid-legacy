Configuration package.  Provides a facade to an application-wide set of
properties.  At the moment it is implemented as a set of key/value pairs,
that can be loaded from 'Property' files, urls and/or streams, or set individually.
<p>
It should be extendable so that it could read from XML files as well, but so
far there does not seem to have been any reason to do so.
