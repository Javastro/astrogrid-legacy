Constructs an object tree from a JobXML document, 
and then serializes this object tree to create an SQL statement.

<p>
FUTURE:
Wonder how configurable this is for other database flavours - would be nice to just have to alter a properties file, 
rather than overriding classes.
<p>
Alternative - use an XSL stylesheet instead to directly transform from JobXML to SQL.- may provide to add this as an alternative 
query factory.
