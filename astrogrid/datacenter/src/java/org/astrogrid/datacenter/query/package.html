Constructs an object tree from a JobXML document, 
and then serializes this object tree to create an SQL statement.

<p>
Unsure how extensible / configurable this is for other database flavours - would be nice to just have to alter a properties file, 
rather than overriding classes.
<p>
Could have implemented more simply. using an XSL stylesheet instead to directly transform from JobXML to SQL.- may choose to add this as an alternative 
query factory.
