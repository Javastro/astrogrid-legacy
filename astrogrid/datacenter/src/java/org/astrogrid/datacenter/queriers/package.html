<h3>Introduction & Purpose</h3>
Handles the translation between the ADQL submitted to the server and the
backend database, and in reverse between the results returned by the database
and the VOTable (or other 'VO-agreed standard') format to be returned by the
server.
<p>
Note that both ways then are many/many; the ADQL is likely to go through different
versions, there will be many different databases, some of which may be bespoke
(rather than JDBC/SQL variants).  Similarly the return may be JDBC ResultSet, but
may be some other bespoke format, to be translated to VOTable or FITS or
whatever.
<p>
The querier must also be able to cope with both synchronous (blocking) and
asynchronous (spawned, or separately threaded) queries.
<p>
Also provides framework of a system to translate between ADQL and SQL. See subpackages for database-specific
implementations. See {@link org.astrogrid.datacenter.queriers.TranslationFrame} for explanation of the translation system.
