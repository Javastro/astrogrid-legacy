<h1>Classes to execute a {@link org.astrogrid.datacenter.axisdataserver.types.Query}</h1>

The classes in this package handles the translation between the query submitted
to the server and the
backend database, and in reverse between the results returned by the database
and the VOTable (or other 'VO-agreed standard') format to be returned by the
server.
<p>
Note that both ways then are many/many; the query language could be SQL, or a newer language such
as ADQL that is  likely to go through different
versions; there will be many different backends, some databases, some of which may be bespoke
(rather than JDBC/SQL variants).  Similarly the return may be JDBC ResultSet, but
may be some other bespoke format, to be translated to VOTable or FITS or
whatever.
<p>
The querier must also be able to cope with both synchronous (blocking) and
asynchronous (spawned, or separately threaded) queries.
<p>
<h2>Classes</h2>
The {@link org.astrogrid.datacenter.queriers.Querier} class is an abstraction of executing a query
Concrete subclasses extend this class with the specifics of performing a query over a particular
datastore - whether that is some flavour of JDBC database, or something more exotic.
<p>

The {@link org.astrogrid.datacenter.queriers.QuerierManager} is a factory responsible for
instantiating  <tt>Querier</tt> instances that are appropriate
for a particular datacenter installation. The subclass of <tt>Querier</tt> that the factory
produces is determined by settings in an external configuration file.

<h2>QueryTranslator</h2>
This package also provides a framework for writing translators between ADQL and SQL.
This feels like its in the wrong package now. See subpackages for database-specific
implementations.

<p>
The base translator class - {@link org.astrogrid.datacenter.queriers.QueryTranslator} 
- provides the machinery to traverse the object tree (using the dynamic 
visitor pattern implemented in the {@link org.astrogrid.datacenter.adql} package). 
It maintains a {@link org.astrogrid.datacenter.queriers.TranslationFrame.Stack} 
of {@link org.astrogrid.datatacenter.queriers.TranslationFrame} objects. These store the intermediate results of the translation
process.
