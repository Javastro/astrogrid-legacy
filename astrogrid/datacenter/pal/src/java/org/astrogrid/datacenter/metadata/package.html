<h2>Metadata</h2>
Virtual Observatory components are expected to have somewhere a VODescription
document, which is an XML document consisting of one or more VOResource elements.
Datacenters expect to hold the master copy of their metadata, and serve this out
to registries (for example) on request.  Updates might also be 'pushed' to the
Registries.
<p>
This package provides classes that serve such VO documents.
