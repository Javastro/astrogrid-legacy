I've just checked all these in as a working base for the Query Builder. They
are pages from Mike Reid (ROE)'s SSA pages. - MCH

Text from his email:

I've tarred all (I hope) the stuff up for you and it's attached, most of
the html inlcude files and all the jsps sit in the top of the webappss
container in my case webapss/ssa. The first page is at
http://surveys.roe.ac.uk/ssa/menu.html ( this is also in the tar).

Basically this calls menu.jsp, whose drawn form actions menu1.jsp
then menu2.jsp. Parameters are passed along via html form tags
(some hidden). I think there's probably a better way of doing this but...

There's a hardwired bit that checks to see if any of the SSA quality
columns of picked in which case a default value of 2048 is placed
in the next form.

The forms eventaully builds an SQL query which is forwarded to
my generic servlet or shown in a textarea for editing.

Recently the initial tables of columns are generated automatically
(but held as static files) from parsing of our SQL scripts this
allows for highlighting of the index columns etc.
