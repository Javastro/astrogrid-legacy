 
Whats all this then?

This directory contains 'packaging templates' - folder hierarchies, configuration files, blah, that are used to construct the final artefacts of the project.

/axis - base axis web application (cut all the cruft from original distribution)
/datacenter-server - template of a zip that will be overlaid on the axis web application
to install the datacenter
/pal - template for the publishers astrogrid library - everything needed to deploy
a datacenter application.
