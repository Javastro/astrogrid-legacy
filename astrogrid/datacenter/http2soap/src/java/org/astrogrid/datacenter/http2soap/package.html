<h1>Java interface to a legacy web service</h1>
This package creates a java-binding to a legacy web service that is implemented via HTTP-GET and HTTP-POST.
<p>
The legacy web service is described in an XML file conforming to the <tt>legacy-service-descriptor.xsd</tt> schema
<p>
An XSLT transformation (<tt>generate-interface.xsl</tt>) is used to generate the source for a Java interface from the
legacy service descriptor. 
<p>
The compiled interface class and definition file can be passed to {@link org.astrogrid.datacenter.http2soap.LegacyService#createImplementation}
which returns an implementation of the interface that acts as a delegate for the legacy web service.
<p>

<h1>Service Definition</h1>

A legacy web service comprises a set of legacy web methods. Each method is defined in the legacy service descriptor XML file.
A method definition contains a 
<dl>
<dt>RequestMapper<dd> which converts input parameters to a form suitable for the legacy web service, and then performs the call to the web service
<dt>ResponseConvertor Pipeline <dd> A pipeline of processing stages that massage the value returned by the call to the legacy web service.
<dt>ResultBuilder <dd> which builds the value to be returned from the method call, using the output of the processing pipeline.
</dl>


<h2>RequestMapper</h2>
All RequestMappers must implement the {@link org.astrogrid.datacenter.http2soap.RequestMapper} interface.
At present only HTTP-GET and HTTP-POST are supported. Others could by implemented later - HTTP-HEAD for example, or something like XML-RPC

<h2>ResponseConvertor Pipeline</h2>
The pipline may contain zero or more processing steps. Each processing step is provided by a class that implements the 
{@link org.astrogrid.datacenter.http2soap.ResponseConvertor} interface.
Convertors that apply an XSLT transformation, extract a regular expression and run a script to produce a result are provided.

<h2>ResultBuilder</h2>
Result builders must implement the {@link org.astrogrid.datacenter.http2soap.RequestBuilder} interface.
Builders for boolean, byte array, DOM Element, float, int, string and void return types are provided. Others can be implemented as needed
