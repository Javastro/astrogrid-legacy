	<h1>CDS Vizier Astrogrid Datacenter</h1>
	
	This project implements an astrogrid datacenter backend-plugin that performs queries against the Vizier meta-catalogue provided by CDS.
	
	
	<h2>Overview</h2>
	CDS have published a basic web service interface to Vizier, and some of their other resources - Aladin, UCD catalogue, etc.

	<h2>CDS Delegates</h2>
	The {@link org.astrogrid.datacenter.cdsdelegate} package hierarchy contains the axis stub classes generated from the WSDL for
	each of the CDS web services. The WSDL provided isn't as strongly-typed or descriptive as it could be - hence these packages also provide
	delegate clients to access the CDS web services through. These wrap the generated stubs, and lift the level of abstraction - returning 
	enumerated types rather than strings, for example.
	<p />
	These delegates are independent of the astrogrid datacenter code, and could be used in isolation to access the CDS services. UCD resolution
	seems seems a good candidate.
	
	<h2>CDS Querier</h2>
	The {@link org.astrogrid.datacenter.cds.querier} package contains a datacenter backend plugin that performs queries against the Vizier 
	catalogue server. This integrates astrogrid and vizier - vizier will appear within astrogrid as another datacenter.

	
	<h2>Future Work</h2>
