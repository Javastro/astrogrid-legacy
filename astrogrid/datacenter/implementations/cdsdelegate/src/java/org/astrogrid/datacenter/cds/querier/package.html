		<h1>Vizier Datacenter backend</h1>
		This package implements a datacenter backend that performs queries against the Vizier catalogue-of-catalogues at CDS.
	<h2>Plugin Installation</h2>
	The plugin SPI class is {@link org.astrogrid.datacenter.cds.querier.VizierQuerier}. To use this backend, the following properties should be set in the
	<tt>AstroGridConfig.properties</tt> file for the datacenter
	<pre>
QuerierSPI=org.astrogrid.datacenter.cds.querier.VizierQuerier
DatabaseQuerierClass=org.astrogrid.datacenter.queriers.spi.PluginQuerier		
	</pre>
	
	<h2>Input Query Format</h2>
	Presently, the plugin expects queries in ADQL. However, as the vizier datacenter isn't backed by a relational database, the adql document is
	interpreted in a different. The querier looks for certain column and table names to query against - any other functions, ordering, group-by or other 
	processing instructions are ignored.
	
	<p />
	<i>I'm going to present examples in the sql-equiuvalent for adql - otherwise they become too verbose.</i>
	<h3>Search Type</h3>
	  If the list of tables specified by the query contains a table called 'metadata' then a meta-catalogue search will be performed. Otherwise
	  a catalogue search will be performed.
	  <pre>
	  	select * from metadata
	  </pre>
	perform a meta-catalogue search.
	<pre>
		select * from atable
	</pre>
	perform a catalogue search.
	
	<h3>Criteria</h3>
	The vizier service can be searched on a number of criteria - these are expressed in ADQL as a where clause on a particular column. Only equality
	conditions are supported. Conditions may only be composed using the<tt>and</tt> logical operator - other logical operators (<tt>or</tt>, <tt>not</tt>, etc) are
	not supported.
	<h4>Target (required)</h4>
	Targets may either be given by name, or position.
	<h5>By Name</h5>
	The <tt>target</tt> and <tt>radius</tt>  columns must be specified
	<pre>
		select * from atable where target='alpha centuri' and radius=1.0 ' ...
	</pre>

	<h5>By Position</h5>
	or by position, using the circle ADQL expression - this gives Ra, Dec and Radius
	<pre>
		select * from atable where Circle(ra=3.45,dec=4.65,radius=1.0) ...
	</pre>
	
	<h4>Unit (required)</h4>
	The units that the <tt>radius</tt> column is measured in. May be one of <tt>deg</tt>, <tt>arcmin</tt>, <tt>arcsec</tt>(not case sensitive)
<pre>
	select * from atable where ... and unit='deg'
</pre>	
	<h4>Wavelength (optional)</h4>
A	wavelength to restrict the search to. Leave unspecified to search all wavelengths. 
 Valid values are <tt>X-ray</tt>, <tt>Gamma-ray</tt></tt><tt>IR</tt>, <tt>Optical</tt>, <tt>UV</tt>, <tt>EUV</tt>, <tt>Radio</tt>
 (not case sensitive)
<pre>
	select * from atable where ... and wavelength='IR'
</pre>

<h4>Additional Strings (optional)</h4>
Additional search terms may also be provided. These are passed through to vizier, and are used to restict results to those which match the search terms.
Additional strings to search for are expressed using the 'LIKE' sql keyword, The expression used is ignored, just the search string is passed to vizier. For instance
<pre>
	select * from atable where .. and col like 'hubble';
</pre>
will filter the search results to only those that contain the string 'hubble'.	
<p />
More than one additional string expression may be given - then results will be filtered to those that match all the specified strings. 
<p />
The SQL Like keyword provides a wildcard syntax, where % matches any sequence of characters. This is not supported by this querier - % is interpreted literally.
