<h2>Metadata</h2>
The VOResource element may not be sufficient to describe everything about this
datacenter that we want to say. Particularly detailed table/column information
that might be used for building queries.
<p>So the metadata here must <i>include</i> a VODescription/VOResource element,
but may include other things.
