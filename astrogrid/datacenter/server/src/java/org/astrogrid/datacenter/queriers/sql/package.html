<h2>Vanilla SQL Querying</h2>
<h3>Introduction & Purpose</h3>
This package provides a 'standard' SQL implementation of a JDBC/SQL querier,
ADQL-&gtSQL translator, and SQL ResultSet -&gt VOtable converter.
<p>
While it is likely that some databases will need different query translators,
the querier and result set converter should be standard enough to cope with
most JDBC/SQL implementations.
<p>
<h3>Runtime</h3>
The appropriate drivers for databases being used should be available in the
class path, and the fully specified classname(s) given in the configuration file
for the code to load.  See the user documentation...
<p>
However this should mean that this is flexible enough to cope with most
JDBC/SQL implementations.
