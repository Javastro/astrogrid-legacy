<h2>Vanilla SQL Querying</h2>
<h3>Introduction & Purpose</h3>
This package provides a 'standard' SQL implementation of a JDBC/SQL querier,
ADQL-&gtSQL translator, and SQL ResultSet -&gt VOtable converter.
<p>
While it is likely that some databases will need different query translators,
the querier and result set converter should be standard enough to cope with
most JDBC/SQL implementations.
<p>
<h3>Runtime</h3>
The appropriate drivers for databases being used should be available in the
class path, and the fully specified classname(s) given in the configuration file
for the code to load.  See the user documentation...
<p>
However this should mean that this is flexible enough to cope with most
JDBC/SQL implementations.

<!--
<p>
The base translator class is extended by {@link org.astrogrid.datacenter.queriers.sql.SqlQueryTranslator} which provides the standard
rules for translating elements of ADQL to the corresponding fragments of SQL. This class is practically declarative
- it simple contains a rule for each language construct.
<p>
This standard ruleset can be extended further, if needed, with specific rules for
 each dialect of SQL you're
translating - look at {@link org.astrogrid.datacenter.queriers.sybase.SybaseQueryTranslator} for example.
 This makes it easy to override
the few rules that differ between different SQL dialects.
<p>
The result of the execution of each rule (a <tt>visit</tt> method) is stored in the current translator frame.
Later rules can retrieve these results by key. This makes the translation
process much more independent of changes to the underlying structure of the
object model, and also handles the (very common) case of some nodes not being
present - no need to check for null, the translatorFrame just returns an
empty string in these cases.
<p>
Because of the reflection, this design is less efficient than a hand-coded
approach. But I figure that can be provided once the schema is settled upon if needed -
until then, these rule-based translators are more declarative and hence much easier to keep up-to-date.
