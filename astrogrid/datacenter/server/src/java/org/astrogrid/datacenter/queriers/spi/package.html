<h1>A structured back-end plugin system</h1>
This package contains a SPI (service provider interface) for backend plugin implementations.
Although it is possible to implement a backend plugin by extending {@link org.astrogrid.datacenter.queriers.Querier} directly,
this has several disadvantages
<ul>
	<li><tt>Querier</tt> is a large class, and it is not clear which methods / fields are available for use by the plugin implementor</li>
	<li><tt>Querier</tt> is integral to the implementation of the server engine, libable to change, and so does not provide a clear separation between 
		engine and backend-plugin</li>
	<li>Querier is an abstract class, not an interface: this prevents plugin implementations to extend another base class.</li>
</ul>

In response to this, this package defines an interface {@link org.astrogrid.datacenter.queriers.spi.QuerierSPI} that plugins must implement,
and an <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?AdapterPattern">adapter</a> class {@link org.astrogrid.datacenter.queriers.spi.PluginQuerier} that loads and manages a plugin, and wraps it so that 
it appears as a <tt>Querier</tt>.

<h2>Multiple Query Languages</h2>

Datacenters may choose to support more than one possible input query language. The SPI system architecture supports this by including a 
separate language-translation phase before the query is executed. In this phase an appropriate language translator is 
selected and used to convert the query document to a suitable intermediate form. This intermediate form is then passed to 
the code that performs the query itself.

<p>
Hopefully splitting the translation and execution phases of performing a query will result in plugins that are more modular,
and easier to extend and reuse. 
<p>

<h2>Lifecycle of a {@link org.astrogrid.datacenter.queriers.spi.QuerierSPI} plugin</h2>

Backend Plugin implementations should implement the {@link
org.astrogrid.datacenter.queriers.spi.QuerierSPI} interface. This interface defines a set of methods that will be called by
the engine in a fixed order. The plugin lifecycle is as follows:-
<ol>
<li>The server engine instantiates a new Plugin object.
<li>Configure the Plugin object<p>
  The server engine calls the {@link org.astrogrid.datacenter.queriers.spi.QuerierSPI#setWorkspace} method. This gives the plugin access
  to a  workspace for storing temporary files.
<li>Translation Phase<p>
  The server engine calls the {@link org.astrogrid.datacenter.queriers.spi.QuerierSPI#getTranslatorMap} method. This returns a map of the
  query language translators this plugin provides. The server engine chooses a translator from this map, and uses it to convert the
  input query language into an intermediate object. The type of this intermediate object is down to the plugin implementor
  to decide.
<li>Execution Phase<p>
  The server enginer passes the intermediate form of the query to the {@link org.astrogrid.datacenter.queriers.spi.QuerierSPI#doQuery} method of the plugin.
  This performs the query, and returns a {@link org.astrogrid.datacenter.queriers.QueryResults} object.
  <li>Access the Results</li>
  The server engine constructs the response to be sent to the user, by accessing the data in the <tt>QueryResults</tt> object returned by the previous phase.
<li>Close the plugin<p>
  The server engine calls the {@link org.astrogrid.datacenter.queriers.spi.QuerierSPI#close} method of the plugin. This is the signal for the plugin to
  close database connections and free any other resources. The plugin object, and the <tt>queryResults</tt> object are now dead and won't be used again.
</ol>

<h2>Translation Phase</h2>
A plugin must provide a collection of query language translator objects. These are maintained in a {@link org.astrogrid.datacenter.queriers.spi.TranslatorMap}
which is accessed via the  {@link org.astrogrid.datacenter.queriers.spi.QuerierSPI#getTranslatorMap} method of the plugin.
<p>
Individual translator objects can be accessed from this map by unique key. 
The keys used in the map are the XML namespaces for the supported input query languages.
 Many query languages (XPath,XQuery,XSLT) already  define a namspace; for those that do not,
 we have defined constants :
 <ul>
 	<li>ADQL - {@link org.astrogrid.datacenter.adql.ADQLUtils#ADQL_XMLNS}, (for the version used in astrogrid)</li>
 	<li>SQL - {@link org.astrogrid.datacenter.sql.SQLUtils#SQL_XMLNS} </li>
 </ul>
New namespace constants will be defined as new languages / versions are adopted by Astrogrid, unless they already define one.
<p>
All input queries are expected to have a namespace (<tt>xmlns</tt>) attribute - this is used to select a suitable translator from the map.
To submit an input query that does not specify its namespace is an error.

<h3>{@link org.astrogrid.datacenter.queriers.spi.Translator}</h3>
The plugin provides a map of <tt>Translator</tt> objects. A <tt>Translator</tt>converts an input query in some xml-based language 
into another representation. The type of this representation is the choice of the plugin developer. 
For example, a backend plugin wrapping a relational database could provide <tt>Translator</tt>
objects that converted various input query languages to simple SQL strings. 
<p>
Plugins for other kinds of datastore may translate to other string-based languages (/bin/sh?,perl?) or to data structure that is then interpreted by the
query execution phase - as in the <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?CommandObject">Command Pattern</a>.

<h2>Execution Phase</h2>
After translating the query, the server engine passes the resulting intermediate representation to the plugin's 
{@link org.astrogrid.datacenter.queriers.spi.QuerierSPI#doQuery} method. This method takes a {@link java.lang.Object} as a parameter. 
However as the set of available translators is defined by the plugin, it has knowledge of what class the intermediate representation
will be. So the first thing the <tt>doQuery()</tt> method will do is cast its parameter from <tt>Object</tt> to the 
expected type.
<p>
	<i>
Its probably a good idea for all translators provided by a plugin to return the same
intermediate type. However, this isn't necessary.
</i>
<p>


<h2>Supporting Classes</h2>

<h3>BaseQuerierSPI</h3>
Starter implementation of QuerierSPI. Implements the configuration methods, storing the results in protected
member variables. Plugin writers should implement <tt>doQuery()</tt>, <tt>close()</tt> if needed,
 and populate the provided simple translator map.

<h3>IdTranslator</h3>
Dummy translator that returns its {@link org.w3c.dom.Element} parameter unchanged. Useful when no separate translation
stage is needed.

<h3>SimpleTranslatorMap</h3>
Simple implementation of a translator map. should be sufficient for most requirements.
Provides methods to add bindings to the map.

<h2>Configuration</h2>
To select the backend plugin used by a datacenter, the following properties must be set:
<ul>
<li>{@link org.astrogrid.datacenter.queriers.QuerierManager#DATABASE_QUERIER_KEY} must be set to <tt></tt>org.astrogrid.datacenter.queriers.spi.PluginQuerier</tt></li>
<li>{@link org.astrogrid.datacenter.queriers.spi.PluginQuerier#QUERIER_SPI_KEY} must be set to the class name of the class that implements {@link org.astrogrid.datacenter.queriers.spi.QuerierSPI}</li>
</ul>


<h2>Examples</h2>
The {@link org.astrogrid.datacenter.queriers.sql} package contains a back-end
plugin that performs queries over a JDBC database. It provides translators that: convert ADQL to SQL; and pass SQL through unchanged.
<p>
The separate <a
href="http://www.astrogrid.org/maven/docs/snapshot/datacenter/multiproject/cdsdelegate/i
ndex.html">CDS Delegate project</a> is a plugin that performs queries by calling
the CDS vizier web services. In this case the plugin translators convert input queries into objects of a class 
that represents the options and parameters the vizier web service accepts. 

<h2>Design Notes.</h2>

 There needs to be a method to access the translator map, rather than a static member
variable, to give the possibility that map can be constructed dynamically if 
needed. For example the set of supported languages could change depending on the 
circumstances of installation.<p>
