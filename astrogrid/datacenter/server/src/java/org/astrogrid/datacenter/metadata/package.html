<h2>Metadata</h2>
The VOResource element may not be sufficient to describe everything about this
datacenter that we want to say. Particularly detailed table/column information
that might be used for building queries.
<p>So a datacenter's metadata file must <i>include</i> a VODescription/VOResource element,
but may include other things.
<p>This package has classes to retrieve, and hopefully classes to help make & maintain
a datacenter's metadata.
<p>Some items may be automatically buildable - for example, for an RDBMS database,
you may be able to query the database itself for it's table and column characteristics.
The plugin mechanism should be able to describe what data formats it can accept
and return.
<p>etc
