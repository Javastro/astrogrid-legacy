To install AstroGrid services on a RedHat Linux system, execute as root:

setup.sh

This will download and install java for you.


Then execute, as the user you have designated to run AstroGrid services:

setup.sh

You will be prompted to enter local settings or keep the defaults. These are saved so that you can re-run the script at a later date and amend these settings if you wish.



If at any point you wish to remove the services you have installed completely, then execute:

reset.sh

This will uninstall all the AstroGrid services, but will _not_ uninstall java
