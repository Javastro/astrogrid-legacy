NOTES
=====

The makefile included here is now obsoleted by the ant "build.xml"
file, and will eventually be removed.  Please use ant as your 
compilation tool ( see http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/ ).


STEP 1: WHERE TO PUT THE SOURCE
-------------------------------

This project directory needs to be installed in an "org/astrogrid" 
source tree, at org/astrogrid/ace/utils.  This is necessary so that 
ant can handle source dependencies properly.



STEP 2: CONFIGURING THE ANT BUILDFILE
-------------------------------

You will need to edit build.xml to match your installation details.
The "basedir" attribute in the <project> tag needs to match the 
directory where your org/astrogrid/ source tree lives.  For example, 
if your local path to this README file is

  "/home/someuser/AstroGrid/SourceCode/org/astrogrid/ace/utils/README", 

then you'll need the following:

<project name="org.astrogrid.ace.utils" default="classes" 
                basedir="/home/someuser/AstroGrid/SourceCode">"


NB:  If your ant installation has problems with the "depend" target,
it's safe to comment the following lines out:

    <depend srcdir="${src}" destdir="${dest}" 
        includes="${pkgpath}/*" cache="depcache" closure="yes"/>



STEP 3: COMPILATION AND TESTING
-------------------------------

To compile the classes:

    ant classes

To run a simple test:

    ant test

The test should create tmp/out.sex, tmp/out.param and tmp/newdata.xml.
