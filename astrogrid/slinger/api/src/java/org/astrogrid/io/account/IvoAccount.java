/**
 * Represents an individual user account within the International Virtual
 * Observatory; ie one that is managed by VO Communities.
 *
 * An account consists of an individual within a community.  The individual may be an
 * automaton (eg a server) rather than human.
 *
 * AstroGrid references to users/accounts are of the form individual@community.
 *
 * While an individual can belong to one and only one community, he/she/it may
 * belong to several 'groups'.  A group may cross community boundaries.
 *
 * [MCH: I'm not sure if group should be specified here - it may be that the user
 * has picked which is the relevent group that has the right credentials for the
 * task.  On the other hand it should probably be the community that looks to see if
 * any of the groups the account belongs to have the right permissions]
 *
 * There are no setter methods.  This is because the token goes along with the
 * individual and community identifiers, and we shouldn't be able to change one
 * without the other.
 *
 * The token is some kind of certification that is carried along with the account
 * and community identifiers to prove that this individual really is this individual...
