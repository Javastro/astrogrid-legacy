The database is (currently) on bern.astro, and the cron job runs on
malmquist, which is local to the data.  There are two users of the
database, 'norman', who has all access, and 'dsaaccess' who has
read-only access from within 130.209.45.%.  The script has 'norman's
MySQL password inside it, in clear.

The scripts' home is /home/norman/rhessi-dsa, and this is currently
parameterised in the upload script.  Adjust this?

Accounts and machines:
    mysql
        On bern.astro
        norman:sitrepdentist and dsaaccess:<no password>
    tomcat
        On www.astro.gla.ac.uk:8080
        manager:dentist4Feets, and norman:norman has the dsaadmin role



Things in this directory:

Within scripts/
---------------

rhessi2dbase.pro
    The working version of the script

dsa-create.mysql
    MySQL statements to create the database table.  Matched with
    rhessi2dbase.pro, since that outputs its data in the column order
    required for upload to this table.

ssw-for-rhessi
    Invokes SSW/IDL with the environment variables required to get to
    the RHESSI data.  Adapted from Eduard's .cshrc in a rather
    hit-and-miss way.

upload.sh
    The upload script.  See below

 
The upload.sh script works by extracting RHESSI data into an ASCII
file, and then forking off a process to upload that to the database.
Unfortunately, the extraction script turns out to be quadratic in the
length of the time interval.  On malmquist, 2/3/5/7/10/31 days took
25/38/71/147/287/3565s.  I therefore do the upload in (by default)
5-day chunks.


Within old-stuff/
-----------------

rhessi2dbase.pro-orig
    Eduard's original version
rhessi2dbase.pro-with-twiddles
    An abortive version which tries hard to be a bit cleverer about
    which data it extracts (based on files rather than dates), but is
    frustrated by the undocumented/buggy/incomprehensible support for
    this in solarsoft.
upload.sh-with-pipes
    An alternative version of upload.sh, which sends its data through
    named pipes rather than temporary files.  There's some blocking
    problem, though, and this just jams.  No problem -- plain
    upload.sh works OK.

Within dsa/
-----------

The Makefile in this directory handles creating an appropriately
configured .war file, which can then be uploaded in a lump to the
Tomcat on www.astro.




Miscellaneous scribbles
-----------------------

Eduard's script is in rhessi2dbase.pro.  To run it:

    % echo "rhessi2dbase,time_interval=['2005-01-01','2005-01-02']"|./ssw-for-rhessi

That produces a 6.2MB text file, so a whole year is about 1GB.  By the
look of things, I can put this up as a single big table, so the next
thing to do is to work out how to import this sort of stuff into
MySQL, which surely can't be hard.

Describe the table with

    % mysql -h terra -u norman -p dsa <dsa-create.mysql

and load with 

    mysql> load data local infile '/home/norman/rhessi-dsa/out.txt' into table rhessi;

Thus the following works:

    mysql> select starttime,rate0,rate2,rate4 from rhessi where starttime < '2005-01-01T00:03';
