TODO:
Re-register it.
Get Silvia/Kona to prod it.
Check to see if the nightly updates can be persuaded to send me mail.
Sort out the cron job for the monthly global update.

DONE:
Change the 'elipse' column to 'eclipse' (!).  Changes needed in
  dsa-create.mysql and rhessi-metadoc.xml, and then I have to reload
  the entire database (probably).
Same for starttime->time_start, as suggested by Silvia.
Integrate into crontab
Change name from rhessi-dsa-0.1 to, say, just rhessi-dsa, and...
Choose a suitable AuthorityID and publish the resource to the registry
  (done, with org.astrogrid)

and deployed it at http://www.astro.gla.ac.uk:8080/manager (without
changing the name, for the moment)

Try deploying it locally, first (requires config changes).
Edit conf/tomcat-users.xml to add me with dsaadmin role, and to add
conf/Catalina/localhost/rhessi-dsa.{xml,props} as configuration files
for a virtual DSA installation (see
