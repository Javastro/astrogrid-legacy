<h1>UType resolver</h1>

<p>This is utype-resolver version @VERSION@</p>

<p>This is an implementation of the UType resolver described in
Norman's
<a href='http://www.ivoa.net/Documents/latest/utype-uri.html' >IVOA Note</a>
(<a href='note.html' >local copy</a>).</p>

<p>The proposal in that Note is that UTypes should be identified by
URIs, and that organisations should be able to create new UTypes
fairly promiscuously, <em>as long as</em> those new UTypes'
relationships with other more general, and better known, UTypes are
described in a machine-readable fashion.  This resolver makes it easy
to use these relationships.</p>

<p>If an application were presented with some data labelled by a UType
<code>http://example.org/utype#new-utype</code>, then it can
immediately discover which better-known UTypes this is a subclass of,
by dereferencing the URL
<code>http://hostport/utype-resolver/superclasses?http://example.org/utype%23new-utype</code>,
where the <code>hostport</code> is the location of this or any other
UType resolver, and the <code>#</code> character has been replaced by
the escape sequence <code>%23</code>.  This returns a plain list of
superclasses of that UType: if the application recognises any of
these, it can process the labelled data as that type.</p>

<p>The resolver does <em>not</em> have to be preloaded with
information about all the UTypes in the world, or even any of them.
Since part of the proposal in the Note is that UType namespaces be
dereferenceable, the resolver can simply retrieve the
machine-processable representation of the UType when it is first asked
about it, and cache it more-or-less permanently thereafter.</p>

<p>The namespaces this resolver knows about currently are listed on the
