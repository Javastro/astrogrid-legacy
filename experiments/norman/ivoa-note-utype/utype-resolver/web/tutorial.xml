<h1>Declaring UTypes: a tutorial</h1>

<p>Contents:</p>
<?toc?>

<p>The 
<a href='http://www.ivoa.net/Documents/latest/utype-uri.html' >IVOA Note</a>
(<a href='note.html' >local copy</a>) covering UTypes
describes a three-step process for declaring and describing them:</p>

<ol>
<li>Determine a namespace URI, creating a URI in a DNS domain that you
control; then identify individual UType names respecting the syntax
described in <a href='http://www.ivoa.net/Documents/latest/utype-uri.html#utype-uris' >section 2, UTypes as
URIs</a>.</li>

<li>Create documentation for the namespace, as described in <a
href='http://www.ivoa.net/Documents/latest/utype-uri.html#utype-docs' >section 3, Documentation</a>.</li>

<li>Create a simple RDF document expressing how the new UTypes relate
to other standardised or well-known UTypes, as described in <a
href='http://www.ivoa.net/Documents/latest/utype-uri.html#utype-rdf' >section 4, Shared semantics</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p>The first two steps are straightforward, and basically consist of
creating an HTML page which includes <code>&lt;a name="xxx"
&gt;...&lt;/a&gt;</code> fragments which correspond to the UTypes you
want to name.  The third step is probably less familiar to you.</p>

<p>This current document makes this process more concrete, describing
three mechanisms for making the third step straightforward.</p>

<p><em>The following description assumes, for the sake of illustration,
that the <code>http://www.ivoa.net/ut/characterization</code>
namespace has been standardized for the Characterisation model's
UTypes, and that the <code>http://example.ivoa.net/utypes</code>
namespace has been standardized for UTypes themselves.  Neither of
these is (yet) true.</em></p>

<div class='section' id='creating'>
<p class='title'>Creating and documenting UTypes</p>

<p>Let's suppose that you want to create a new UType
<code>sharpBounds</code>, which is a more specific version of the
(presumed standardised) IVOA Characterization
<code>coverage-bounds</code> concept, the full URI version of whose
UType is
<code>http://www.ivoa.net/ut/characterization#coverage-bounds</code>.
You control the (DNS) domain <code>example.org</code>, and can commit
to long-term maintainance of URLs in that domain.  Thus you decide to
create your <code>sharpBounds</code> UType in the namespace
<code>http://example.org/my-utypes</code>.</p>

<p>The first thing to do is to create a web page at
<code>http://example.org/my-utypes.html</code>, which includes, somewhere
within it, text like:</p>
<pre>
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a name='sharpBounds'&gt;Accurate bounds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our data, &lt;code&gt;#sharpBounds&lt;/code&gt; are the
bounds on a bandpass where the transmission goes from 0% to 100%
within 10nm.  This is more specific than the IVOA
&lt;code&gt;coverage-bounds&lt;/code&gt; UType.
</pre>

<p>The only required feature here is that there is a link anchor,
<code>&lt;a name="sharpBounds"&gt;</code>, containing the name of the
new UType.  This documents the UType.</p>

<p>So you've created and documented your UType.  The next step is to
explain this UType's relationship to the (by assumption) well-known
<code>coverage-bounds</code> UType, in a machine-processable form.</p>
</div>

<div class='section' id='relationships'>
<p class='title'>Declaring UType relationships</p>

<p>You make the machine-readable declarations of UType relationships
using RDF, creating a file <code>my-utypes.n3</code> containing:</p>
<pre>
@prefix rdfs:   &lt;http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#&gt;.
@prefix myns:   &lt;http://example.org/my-utypes#&gt;.
@prefix ivoa:   &lt;http://www.ivoa.net/ut/characterization#&gt;.
@prefix utypes: &lt;http://example.ivoa.net/utypes#&gt;.

myns:sharpBounds a utypes:UType; 
    rdfs:subClassOf ivoa:coverage-bounds .
</pre>

<p>This uses the (not yet standardised)
<code>http://example.ivoa.net/utypes#UType</code> class to identify
the <code>sharpBounds</code> concept as a UType.  You can
alternatively use the RDF/XML notation for RDF if you wish, but that
notation is harder to write, and offers few advantages.</p>

<p>The required feature here is that the new <code>sharpBounds</code>
is declared as a <code>utypes:UType</code>, in a namespace which
matches the location of the <code>my-utypes.n3</code> file.</p>

<div class='section'>
<p class='title'>Configuring the web server</p>

<p>The IVOA Note <a href='http://www.ivoa.net/Documents/latest/utype-uri.html#web-recipes' >suggests</a>
configuring your web server so that
retrieving the URL <code>http://example.org/my-utypes</code> (note the
absence of an `extension') will return either the HTML or the RDF
depending on the value of the <code>Accept</code> header in the HTTP
GET transaction.  This is not hard, and the Note includes a recipe for
configuring Apache to do this; but there is a second method.  The
resolver tries to retrieve the unadorned namespace name, but if it
fails, it will then try to retrieve the namespace name followed by
first <code>.n3</code> and then <code>.rdf</code>, as described in the
<a href='interface.html#discovery' >interface description</a>.</p>

<p>And that's all there is to it.</p>
</div>

<div class='section'>
<p class='title'>Trying it yourself</p>

<p>If you've followed these instructions with a real URL you control,
rather than the <code>example.org</code> one, then you can immediately
retrieve the list of superclasses of your new UType using this
resolver.  Retrieve the equivalent of <a
href='superclasses?http://example.org/my-utypes%23sharpBounds'
><code>http://hostport/utype-resolver/superclasses?http://example.org/my-utypes%23sharpBounds</code></a>,
either in a browser, or at the command-line using
<code>curl</code>:</p>
<pre>
% curl 'http://hostport/utype-resolver/superclasses?http://example.org/my-utypes%23sharpBounds'
http://www.ivoa.net/ut/characterization#coverage-bounds
%
</pre>
<p>Note that we escaped the <code>#</code> character by replacing it
with the sequence <code>%23</code>, and we put the whole thing in
quotes to protect the <code>?</code> character from the shell.  Note
that the resolver did not have to be pre-loaded with information about
the UType, nor did it have to look it up in a registry (and you didn't
have to go through an elaborate registration process); when called
upon to explain about the new UType, the resolver was able to retrieve
your new declaration of the new UType's relationships, and immediately
provide you with the results.  The resolver caches the declarations,
so that it does not have to re-retrieve the declarations, the next
time it is asked about this namespace.</p>

<p>This means that any software called upon to process data annotated
as having UType <code>http://example.org/my-utypes#sharpBounds</code>,
which the application does not initially understand, can retrieve this
quickly-constructed URL by any means at its disposal, discover that it
is intended to be a more specific version of
<code>http://www.ivoa.net/ut/characterization#coverage-bounds</code>
(which it presumably does understand), and proceed accordingly.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class='section' id='embedding'>
<p class='title'>Embedding declarations in HTML</p>

<p>The above example has shown how to declare UType relationships
using a pair of files, one containing HTML and the other RDF.  It is
also possible to encode the RDF declarations within the HTML, as
described in <a href='interface.html#discovery-html' >the interface
specification</a>.</p>

<p>This allows us to write the following (X)HTML document:</p>
<pre>
&lt;?xml version='1.0'?&gt;

&lt;html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;title&gt;My sharp bounds UType&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;

&lt;body&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;My sharp bounds definition&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The namespace is
&lt;code class='namespace'
      &gt;http://example.org/my-utypes&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class='utype' id='bound1'&gt;
The class &lt;code&gt;bound1&lt;/code&gt; is a UType
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The class bound2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The class &lt;span class='utype' id='bound2'&gt;bound2 is a 
subclass of &lt;a href='#bound1' rel='subclassof'&gt;bound1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class='utype' id='sharpBounds'&gt;
Class c3 is a subclass of
&lt;a rel='subclassof'
    href='http://www.ivoa.net/ut/characterization#coverage-bounds'
    &gt;the standard characterization bounds UType&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>

<p>The <a href='grok-utypes.xslt' ><code>grok-utypes.xslt</code></a>
XSLT transform turns this into:</p>
<pre>
@prefix rdfs: &lt;http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#&gt;.
@prefix u: &lt;http://example.ivoa.net/utypes#&gt;.
@prefix : &lt;http://example.org/my-utypes#&gt;.

:bound1 a u:UType;
  rdfs:comment "The class bound1 is a UType".
:bound2 a u:UType;
  rdfs:comment "bound2 is a subclass of bound1".
:sharpBounds a u:UType;
  rdfs:comment
    "Class c3 is a subclass of the standard characterization bounds UType".
:bound2 rdfs:subClassOf :bound1.
:sharpBounds rdfs:subClassOf
     &lt;http://www.ivoa.net/ut/characterization#coverage-bounds&gt;.
</pre>

<p>In fact, the fault-tolerant *ML parser within the resolver would
even allow us to write the following (hideously malformed) HTML document:</p>
<pre>
&lt;title&gt;My sharp bounds UType&lt;/title&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;My sharp bounds definition&lt;/h1&gt;

The namespace is
&lt;code class='namespace'
      &gt;http://example.org/my-utypes&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;div class='utype' id='bound1'&gt;
The class &lt;code&gt;bound1&lt;/code&gt; is a UType
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The class bound2&lt;/h2&gt;
The class &lt;span class='utype' id='bound2'&gt;bound2 is a 
subclass of &lt;a href='#bound1' rel='subclassof'&gt;bound1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;div class='utype' id='sharpBounds'&gt;
Class c3 is a subclass of
&lt;a rel='subclassof'
    href='http://www.ivoa.net/ut/characterization#coverage-bounds'
    &gt;the standard characterization bounds UType&lt;/a&gt;
</pre>

<p>...but that <em>really</em> oughtn't to be encouraged.</p>
</div>

<div class='section'>
<p class='title'>Maintaining your UType</p>

<p>Once you've publicised your UType, you are committed to maintaining
the URL which describes it indefinitely, so choose the namespace domain
carefully with that in mind.</p>

<p>If you find bugs in your UType declarations, you should fix them,
but you shouldn't change the meaning of UTypes once you've publicised
them.  If you find you want to do that, you should create a new set of
UTypes (version numbers in the namespace are obviously a good idea),
and declare your new UTypes as subclasses of the UTypes in the older
version.</p>

</div>

<div class='section'>
<p class='title'>Deleting UTypes from the resolver</p>

<p>You can't delete UTypes from the world, but you might need to tell
a resolver to forget what it knows about a namespace, while you are in
the process of developing it.  You can't do this with
<code>curl</code>, so you have to do it by hand.  Supposing you have a
resolver at <code>localhost</code> port 8080, and want
to delete its knowledge of the namespace
<code>http://localhost:8080/utype-resolver/test/testcases/simple1</code>,
you can perform the HTTP transaction `by hand' as follows:</p>
<pre>
% <span class='userinput' >telnet localhost 8080</span>
Trying ::1...
Connected to localhost.
Escape character is '^]'.
<span class='userinput' >DELETE /utype-resolver/description?http://localhost:8080/utype-resolver/test/testcases/simple1 HTTP/1.0</span>
               <em>&lt;-- add this second newline to terminate the request</em>
HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
Server: Apache-Coyote/1.1
Date: Sat, 03 Mar 2007 18:43:11 GMT
Connection: close

Connection closed by foreign host.
%
</pre>

<p>Try doing that with some of the namespaces on this server (listed
<a href="description" >here</a>).  It's OK to do this, since the next
time you or anyone else asks this resolver for the superclasses of a
UType in that namespace, the resolver will simply re-retrieve the
definition.</p>
