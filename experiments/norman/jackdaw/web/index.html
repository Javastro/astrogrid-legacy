<h1>Jackdaw -- find trinkets</h1>

<p>This is Jackdaw version @VERSION@
<img class='smallimage' src='jackdaw.jpg' alt='Image of jackdaw'/></p>

<p>Given a URL, this helps you find more like it!</p>

<p>That is, if you have one or more URLs you rather like, be they
IVORN or plain HTTP URLs, this service will find you some more that it
thinks might be similar.  It has a number of different definitions of
`similar', but it gives you all of them, and lets you decide which
one's useful.</p>

<p>That's about all there is to it.</p>

<p>Well, not really.  Right now, this is only a dummy service, and the
only response it gives you is the same URLs you gave it.  But the
interface shouldn't change....</p>

<h2>Interface</h2>
<p>The interface is dead simple.</p>

<p>You can call the service either
with an HTTP <code>GET</code> or an HTTP <code>POST</code>, giving it
a single <code>url</code> parameter whose value is one or more URLs
separated by commas.  That is, if you have an IVORN
<code>ivo://example/wibble</code>, which you rather like the look of,
then you can find similar ones by dereferencing</p>
<blockquote>
<code>@MYURL@/like?url=ivo://example/wibble</code>
</blockquote>
<p>or by posting <code>url=ivo://example/wibble</code> to the
<code>@MYURL@/like</code> URL using MIME type
<code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code> as usual.</p>

<p>The response in either case is an XML document, which looks like this:</p>
<pre>
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;suggestions xmlns="http://ns.eurovotech.org/jackdaw"&gt;
&lt;group description="Identity suggestion"
       type="http://ns.eurovotech.org/jackdaw/group#identity"&gt;
&lt;url&gt;ivo://wibble/res&lt;/url&gt;
&lt;url&gt;ivo://buckle/my/shoe&lt;/url&gt;
&lt;/group&gt;
&lt;/suggestions&gt;
</pre>
<p>That arrives with a MIME type of <code>application/xml</code>.</p>

<p>If there is not precisely one <code>url</code> parameter in the
request, the service responds with status 400 (Bad Request) and a
<code>text/plain</code> explanation.</p>

<p>There can in principle be multiple <code>group</code> elements,
each with their own <code>type</code> attribute.  Right now, though,
there's only one, it always has type
<code>http://ns.eurovotech.org/jackdaw/group#identity</code>, and it
contains exactly the URLs that were listed in the query.</p>

<p>Any questions?</p>
