<h1>Quaestor: generic SPARQL endpoint</h1>

<p>This is Quaestor @VERSION@, released @RELEASEDATE@</p>

<p>Quaestor is a generic triplestore and SPARQL endpoint, which allows
you to upload ontology and instance data, and query the result through
a RESTful interface.  It's built on top of
<a href='http://jena.sourceforge.net' >Jena</a>.</p>

<p>The following files are available for download:</p>
<dl>
<dt><a href='@WARFILE@'>@WARFILE@</a></dt>
<dd>The Tomcat <code>.war</code> file.  Drop this in a running Tomcat,
or upload it to the management interface.  The Quaestor server's interface is documented
<a href='docs/index.html'>here</a>, as well as on the front page of the running
Quaestor service.</dd>

<dt><a href='@JETTYZIP@'>@JETTYZIP@</a></dt>
<dd>The standalone Jetty server.  Unzip this, and start the server
with the <code>start-jetty.sh</code> shell script.  This presents the
same interface as the Tomcat version above.</dd>

<dt><a href='@CLIENTZIP@'>@CLIENTZIP@</a></dt>
<dd>API docs, and a small jar file which includes
a REPL which allows you to talk to the server if you want to (I
imagine rather few folk really want either, so this is I'm afraid
barely documented)</dd>

<dt><a href='@LIBJAR@'>@LIBJAR@</a></dt>
<dd>Library jar file, which allows you to create Quaestor-like
applications fairly straightforwardly.  Well, it would, if there were
any documentation for that (coming soon, promise...).</dd>

</dl>

<p>The source code is in the
<a href='http://www.astrogrid.org'>AstroGrid</a> project's
<a href='http://www2.astrogrid.org/project/source-code/' >CVS repository</a>
(check out directory <code>experiments/norman/quaestor</code>).
You can also browse this with
<a href='http://www.astrogrid.org/viewcvs/experiments/norman/quaestor/'>ViewVC</a>.
That should be publicly available -- get in touch with me if you have
difficulty getting at it.  The build instructions in the top-level
README should at least help build it; again, get in touch if you have problems.</p>

<p>You can read the quaestor <a href='docs/'>documentation</a>.</p>
