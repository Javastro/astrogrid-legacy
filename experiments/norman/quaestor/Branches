BRANCH nxg-2008-02-11-jetty-quaestor

Created to make Quaestor use Jetty, and thus have an alternative
standalone mode, free of Tomcat.  This needs more work, since the
Jetty support in org/eurovotech/quaestor/SchemeJettyServer.java is
rather crude.  Also, what this has ended up with is a rather odd
beast, with the Jetty support sitting on top of the Tomcat support, in
a way.  Also, the two are currently mixed together untidily in the
build.xml file.

BRANCH nxg-2008-02-13-skua

Created to add the SKUA infrastructure required, immediately after the
nxg-2008-02-11-jetty-quaestor branch was merged.  The changes are
mostly in sparql.scm.  There are actually a variety of useful changes
to the files other than this one, which might be usefully merged onto
the trunk even if the SKUA stuff is abandoned.

HEAD merged here on 2008-05-15, after v0-4-5,
          ...and on 2008-05-18
          ...and on 2008-06-25 (twice!)
(policy: don't make generally useful changes here, but instead make them
on the trunk and merge them -- it's too confusing otherwise)
