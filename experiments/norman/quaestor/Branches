BRANCH nxg-2008-02-11-jetty-quaestor

Created to make Quaestor use Jetty, and thus have an alternative
standalone mode, free of Tomcat.  This needs more work, since the
Jetty support in org/eurovotech/quaestor/SchemeJettyServer.java is
rather crude.  Also, what this has ended up with is a rather odd
beast, with the Jetty support sitting on top of the Tomcat support, in
a way.  Also, the two are currently mixed together untidily in the
build.xml file.

Merged on to HEAD 2008-02-13

BRANCH nxg-2008-02-13-skua

Created to add the SKUA infrastructure required, immediately after the
nxg-2008-02-11-jetty-quaestor branch was merged.  The changes are
mostly in sparql.scm.  There are actually a variety of useful changes
to the files other than this one, which might be usefully merged onto
the trunk even if the SKUA stuff is abandoned.
