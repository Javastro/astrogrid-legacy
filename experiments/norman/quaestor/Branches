BRANCH nxg-2008-02-11-jetty-quaestor

Created to make Quaestor use Jetty, and thus have an alternative
standalone mode, free of Tomcat.  This needs more work, since the
Jetty support in org/eurovotech/quaestor/SchemeJettyServer.java is
rather crude.  Also, what this has ended up with is a rather odd
beast, with the Jetty support sitting on top of the Tomcat support, in
a way.  Also, the two are currently mixed together untidily in the
build.xml file.

Merged on to TRUNK 2008-02-13
