Quaestor: a generic SPARQL endpoint.

To build, requires Tomcat, Jena and SISC.

It works with both Java 1.4 and 1.5, and with Tomcat 5.0.x and 5.5.x.

I've only tried it with Jena 2.3 -- other versions may or may not
work.  See <http://jena.sourceforge.net>.

SISC is available from <http://sisc.sourceforge.net>.  Quaestor works
with sisc-1.13.5 at least, and probably later versions also.  It
requires a little bit of post-installation configuration.  Download
sisc-1.13.5 (or later, presumably):
  % cd .../sisc-x.y.z ;installation directory
  % ./install-srfi22.sh $PWD
  % chmod +x srfi-22.sh
  % PATH=.:$PATH scheme-src/build-heapjar.scm

Building Quaestor
-----------------

Copy build.properties.template to build.properties and fill in the
following properties:

  catalina.home : the directory which should be assigned to the
  environment variable CATALINA_HOME, that is, the directory
  containing bin/, webapps and so on.

  jena.lib : Jena library directory.  This is the directory which
  contains the jena.jar file and friends. 

  sisc.bin : the binary directory is the one which contains the sisc
  program.

  sisc.lib : the directory which contains sisc{,-opt,-lib}.jar and
  sisc.shp (in the SISC binary distributions, this is usually the same
  directory as sisc.bin).

Then 'ant && ant dist' to make the .war file.

Testing
-------

To run the full regression tests, you'll have to install the
application in a Tomcat server.  Do that either by creating the .war
file ('ant dist'), or with 'ant install', after making sure that
manager.url has the correct value in the build.xml file (or in
build.properties).  Then 'ant test' should work.
