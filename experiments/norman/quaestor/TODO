* Things to do

** Make the distribution more compact

At the moment, both the Jetty and WAR distributions are
splendiferously humungous, because the way that the jar file is
constructed in both cases is by unpacking all the dependency jar files
and bundling them into a single jar.

I spent quite a bit of time trying to get Proguard to work with
quaestorlib, but I think it's ultimately futile, because there
appear to be lots of cases where classes are loaded dynamically,
which means each one has to be analysed to work out which class
has to be kept, and that looks like a long slog.  Still, there must be
some cleverer way to do it than just putting the kitchen sink in there.

** Get REPL working again

Somehow, typing (ident) or (chatter) at the Quaestor REPL no longer
works, as they're not defined.  This certainly used to work, but as of
2007-11-22 it's not any more.  I've tried playing with
SchemeWrapper.evalInputStream, both versions, adding the
DynamicEnvironment in the one-arg one, and trying to eval CHATTER
immediately after the initialisation using scheme-wrapper-support.scm,
but nothing obvious works.

Well, it seems to work again, apparently spontaneously (hmm).
Starting up the Java client REPL allows you to get both (ident) and
(chatter).
