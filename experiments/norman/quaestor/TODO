** Get REPL working again

Somehow, typing (ident) or (chatter) at the Quaestor REPL no longer
works, as they're not defined.  This certainly used to work, but as of
2007-11-22 it's not any more.  I've tried playing with
SchemeWrapper.evalInputStream, both versions, adding the
DynamicEnvironment in the one-arg one, and trying to eval CHATTER
immediately after the initialisation using scheme-wrapper-support.scm,
but nothing obvious works.
