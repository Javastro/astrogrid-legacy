Release XXX
------------

* You can now successfully retrieve a knowledgebase which has no
  submodels (you don't get any RDF, but you don't get an error, either)

Release 0.5.1, 2008 October 7
-----------------------------

* Changed various defaults, so that now RDF/XML is much more
  consistently the default RDF language for upload and download, and
  Turtle is more consistently referred to instead of Notation3.
  Corresponding changes to documentation.

* Substantially reworked the access-control demo, bringing it up to
  date with Quaestor 0.5, and changed defaults.


Release 0.5, 2008 September 28
------------------------------

The first release to get fairly broad distribution.
