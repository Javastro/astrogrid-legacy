Release 0.5.1, 2008 October 7
-----------------------------

* Changed various defaults, so that now RDF/XML is much more
  consistently the default RDF language for upload and download, and
  Turtle is more consistently referred to instead of Notation3.
  Corresponding changes to documentation.

* Substantially reworked the access-control demo, bringing it up to
  date with Quaestor 0.5, and changed defaults.


Release 0.5, 2008 September 28
