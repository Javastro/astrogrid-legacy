Release 0.5.5, 2009 March 10
----------------------------

* Reworking of JettySchemeServer.java to support startup options correctly

Release 0.5.4, 2009 January 6
-----------------------------

* Reworking of RDF:CREATE-PERSISTENT-MODEL-FACTORY
  The returned factory object now has contract
  (jena-model? -> jena-model?) or (string? -> <java.io.file>), and the
  constructed assembler file is now persistent, as opposed to being
  deleted as soon as it is used.
* Added RDF:->URI, which converts various things to URI, or extracts
  a URI from them.


Release 0.5.3, 2008 October 20
------------------------------

* Add RDF:MUTATE/CHANGESET! procedure to jena.scm, which supports
  mutating a model using a 'Talis Changeset' specification.

Release 0.5.2, 2008 October 15
------------------------------

* You can now successfully retrieve a knowledgebase which has no
  submodels (you don't get any RDF, but you don't get an error, either)

* Extensions and adjustments to library functionality,
  as required by AGAST Qadi application.

* Some changes to demo text.

Release 0.5.1, 2008 October 7
-----------------------------

* Changed various defaults, so that now RDF/XML is much more
  consistently the default RDF language for upload and download, and
  Turtle is more consistently referred to instead of Notation3.
  Corresponding changes to documentation.

* Substantially reworked the access-control demo, bringing it up to
  date with Quaestor 0.5, and changed defaults.


Release 0.5, 2008 September 28
------------------------------
