<h1>Quaestor demo</h1>

<p>This is a demo of the reasoning capabilities described
<a href="http://nxg.me.uk/note/2006/access-control/">elsewhere</a>.  To
work through the demo, you need to have a Quaestor service running
inside a Tomcat server: I'll take that to be running at
<code>http://localhost:8080/quaestor</code>.
You need at least Quaestor v0.5.</p>

<p>The Quaestor interface is documented on the front page of the
Quaestor server.  It uses the HTTP protocol commands to manipulate
then query the server, so you need <code>curl</code> or some other
tool which can generate HTTP <code>GET</code>, <code>PUT</code> and
<code>POST</code> commands (the <code>wget</code> program can do
<code>POST</code>, but not <code>PUT</code>).
Or write a Java client.
Or you can just talk HTTP yourself, using telnet to port 8080.</p>

<h2><a name="id54666" id="id54666">The HTTP demo</a></h2>


<p>First, create a new knowledgebase, with a <code>PUT</code>
command, as follows.  Call the knowledgebase `testing', and upload a simple bit of
RDF, contained in the file <code>kb-metadata.ttl</code>:</p>
<pre>
% curl --upload-file kb-metadata.ttl \
    --header content-type:text/turtle \
    http://localhost:8080/quaestor/kb/testing
%
</pre>
<p>Note that we have to tell Quaestor that the input is Turtle, and
not the default RDF/XML.  It is also possible to POST a plain text
description at this point (it's equivalent to adding metadata with
only a <code>dc:description</code> property), but that won't do here,
as the work we want to do below requires us to use a reasoner within
the knowledgebase, and so we must tell Quaestor to configure this, within the
<code>kb-metadata.ttl</code> file.</p>

<p>The backslashes in this command, by the way, let us break the command
onto multiple lines – omit them if you type the command on a single line.</p>

<p>If you add the <code>--verbose</code> flag to the <code>curl</code>
command line, you will see (instructive?) protocol chatter, as well as
the 204 (no content) return code from the server.</p>

<p>Retrieving the URL <code>http://localhost:8080/quaestor/kb</code>,
either using <code>curl</code> or in a web browser, will show you that
you have created this knowledgebase.</p>

<p>Now you can add to the knowledgebase the three sets of assertions
contained in files <code>access-control.owl</code>,
<code>instances.ttl</code> and <code>identity.ttl</code>.  Add these to
the knowledgebase <em>submodels</em> <code>ontology</code>,
<code>people</code> and <code>identities</code> respectively (the
names are arbitrary, and you can use alternatives if you wish).</p>
<pre>
% curl --upload-file access-control.owl \
    http://localhost:8080/quaestor/kb/testing/ontology
% curl --upload-file instances.ttl \
    'http://localhost:8080/quaestor/kb/testing/people?instances' \
    --header content-type:text/turtle
% curl --upload-file identity.ttl \
    http://localhost:8080/quaestor/kb/testing/identities \
    --header content-type:text/turtle
%
</pre>
<p>The two <code>.ttl</code> files are written in
<a href='http://www.w3.org/TeamSubmission/turtle/' >Turtle</a>;
this is equivalent (in this context) to 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Notation3">Notation 3</a>,
which you may otherwise have heard of.
Since this is not the default MIME type which Quaestor expects, we
must include a <code>Content-Type</code> header.  The
<code>access-control.owl</code> file, however, is written in the
default RDF/XML serialisation, so we do not need to add a
<code>Content-Type</code> header to the upload, though it is not
wrong, and generally better, to include it anyway.
The <code>instances.ttl</code> file is uploaded with a
<code>?instances</code> query attached – this tells the reasoner that
these are assertions about individuals rather than types; this
distinction is currently important.</p>

<p>The <code>access-control.owl</code> file expresses an access policy
(you can read it more legibly in the file
<code>access-control.ttl</code>, and see the class hierarchy, but not
the relevant class definitions, in the image
<code>access-control.png</code>, obtained from
<a href='http://protege.stanford.edu' >Protégé</a>).  The intent is
that both members of UK instititions and members of the X
Collaboration can see all of the data, and that members of African
countries can see a flagged subset of the data.</p>

<p>If you now look again at <a href="http://localhost:8080/quaestor/kb"><code>http://localhost:8080/quaestor/kb</code></a> you will see the
knowledgebase and its submodels listed.</p>

<p>You can retrieve the individual submodels from the Quaestor
service:</p>
<pre>
% curl http://localhost:8080/quaestor/kb/testing/people
</pre>
<p>will respond with the contents of the <code>people</code> submodel
in the default RDF/XML format (MIME type <code>application/rdf+xml</code>),
and if you add <code>--header accept:text/turtle</code> to the
<code>curl</code> command, you'll 
get it in Turtle again.  If you retrieve
<code>http://localhost:8080/quaestor/kb/testing</code> you'll get the
union of the three submodels.</p>

<p>There are several SPARQL queries in the demo for you to try.  The
query <a href="access-all.rq"><code>access-all.rq</code></a> is:</p>
<pre>
prefix : &lt;http://eurovotech.org/access-control.owl#&gt;
select ?person
where { ?person a :CanSeeAllData }
</pre>
<p>You can post this file with an HTTP <code>POST</code> request:</p>
<pre>
% curl --header content-type:application/sparql-query \
    --data-binary @access-all.rq \
    http://localhost:8080/quaestor/kb/testing
[...]
%
</pre>
<p>This should respond with an XML document which conforms to the
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-sparql-XMLres/">SPARQL response
scheme</a>.  If you add <code>--header accept:text/plain</code> or
<code>--header accept:text/csv</code> to the
command, the reasoner will produce a response in the corresponding
format.  For example:</p>
<pre>
curl --header content-type:application/sparql-query \
     --data-binary @access-all.rq \
     http://localhost:8080/quaestor/kb/testing \
    --header accept:text/csv
person
mailto:norman@astro.gla.ac.uk
urn:example#Norman
urn:example#Guy
urn:example#Nelson
urn:example#Jonathan
%
</pre>
<p>Compare this with the contents of the <code>instances.ttl</code>
file.  Individuals <code>urn:example#Norman</code> and
<code>urn:example#Guy</code> can see all the data because they are
members of UK institutions; <code>mailto:norman@astro.gla.ac.uk</code>
can see all the data because he is asserted to be identical with
<code>urn:example#Norman</code>; Nelson and Jonathan can see all of
the data because they are members of the collaboration; Markus,
Sébastien and Tutankhamun are locked out (sorry!).</p>

<p>There are several other queries you can try:</p>
<dl>

<dt><a href="access-flagged.rq">access-flagged.rq</a></dt>
<dd>This query asks which individuals are in the flagged-data group.
If you run this query, you see that everyone who can see all of the
data can also see the flagged subset (which makes sense), but that
<code>urn:example#Tutankhamun</code> can also see the subset, because
he’s at an African institution.</dd>

<dt><a href="ask-norman.rq">ask-norman.rq</a></dt>
<dd>This query asks the yes/no question of whether
<code>norman@astro.gla.ac.uk</code> is allowed to see all the data
(the answer is ‘yes’).
Note that <code>text/csv</code> isn't an acceptable response format
for an ASK query, so you'll have to use either
<code>application/sparql-results+xml</code>, which is the default, or <code>text/plain</code>.</dd>

<dt><a href="construct-accessers.rq">construct-accessers.rq</a></dt>
<dd>This uses a SPARQL <code>construct</code> query to obtain a query
result in RDF.  Only one or other of the RDF types is acceptable as a
response format (the default is, as usual, RDF/XML).</dd>

<dt><a href="ask-badly.rq">ask-badly.rq</a></dt>
<dd>This query is malformed (there's a missing angle bracket).  The
reasoner responds with an HTTP 400 status.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Finally, you can delete the knowledgebase with the HTTP
<code>DELETE</code> command, which you can produce using <code>curl</code>
as follows:</p>
<pre>
% curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/quaestor/kb/testing
</pre>

<h2><a name="id54989" id="id54989">The XML-RPC demo</a></h2>


<p>Quaestor also has an XML-RPC interface, with an endpoint at
<code>http://localhost:8080/quaestor/xmlrpc</code>, though it has
rather less functionality at present.</p>

<p>The file <code><a href="xmlrpc-get-model.xml">xmlrpc-get-model.xml</a></code>
contains an XML-RPC method call:</p>
<pre>
&lt;methodCall&gt;
&lt;methodName&gt;get-model&lt;/methodName&gt;
&lt;params&gt;
&lt;param&gt;&lt;value&gt;&lt;string&gt;testing&lt;/string&gt;&lt;/value&gt;&lt;/param&gt;
&lt;/params&gt;
&lt;/methodCall&gt;
</pre>
<p>You can post this to the server as follows:</p>
<pre>
% curl --header content-type:text/xml \
    --data-binary @xmlrpc-get-model.xml \
    http://localhost:8080/quaestor/xmlrpc
%
</pre>
<p>and get a response which simply indicates that you should
dereference another URL.</p>

<p>Slightly more useful is the <code>query-model</code> method,
illustrated in <code><a href="xmlrpc-query-model.xml">xmlrpc-query-model.xml</a></code>.  This makes a 
SPARQL query against the model, and returns a temporary URL which can be
dereferenced to pick up the query results.</p>
