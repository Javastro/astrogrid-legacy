<h1>Notes on MIME types</h1>

<p>The following MIME types are usable at one point or another when
interacting with Quaestor:</p>

<dl>

<dt><code>application/rdf+xml</code></dt>
<dd>This indicates that the content (upload or response) is formatted
in the standard <a href='http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-syntax-grammar/'
>RDF/XML</a> serialisation.</dd>

<dt><code>application/sparql-query</code></dt>
<dd>When annotating a SPARQL response, this produces a response in
XML, using the
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-sparql-XMLres/" >SPARQL response XML 
schema</a>.</dd>

<dt><code>application/x-turtle</code></dt>
<dd><a href='http://www.dajobe.org/2004/01/turtle/' >Turtle</a> is a
well-established but still experimental text syntax for RDF.  It's
very closely related to Notation3, but without some of that syntax's
non-RDF extensions.  The MIME type is not yet registered, but
<code>application/turtle</code> is being requested.</dd>

<dt><code>application/xml</code></dt>
<dd>This is the MIME type which should accompany a POSTed SPARQL
query.  See the <a href='http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-sparql-query/'
>specification</a> for more details.</dd>

<dt><code>text/csv</code> (SELECT query responses only)</dt>
<dd>Comma-separated-value output, conforming to RFC 4180.  The
<code>Content-Type</code> of the response is
<code>text/csv;header=present</code>, indicating that the first line
of the response consists of 'column headings', consisting of the
substitution variables in the input query.  These are not guaranteed
to be in the same order as they were listed in the input query.</dd>

<dt><code>text/plain</code></dt>
<dd><p>This MIME type means various different things in different
contexts.</p>

<p>Annotating a SPARQL response, this indicates that the content is in a
human-readable format, intended to look roughly like the usual 
result of a SQL query.  It is not intended to be
machine-parseable.</p>

<p>The MIME type of the <a
href='http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-testcases/#ntriples' >N-triple
format</a> is also <code>text/plain</code>; however N-triple format is
intended only for the RDF test cases, and is not expected to be useful
otherwise (that's the party line, though in fact N-triple format can
be quite useful when you need something that's trivial to parse, or
when you want, say, to check how base-URIs have been resolved).
When retrieving an ontology (using the <code>GET</code>
HTTP method) or uploading one (using <code>PUT</code>), you can use
<code>text/plain</code> to indicate N-triples (but don't tell W3C).</p>
</dd>

<dt><code>text/rdf+n3</code></dt>
<dd>This indicates that the content (upload or response) is formatted in
<a href='http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Notation3' >Notation-3</a>.
The <code>application/n3</code> MIME type is recognised but
deprecated (see <a href='http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Notation3' >W3
discussion</a>), since its IANA registration was never completed;
<code>text/rdf+n3</code> is the preferred MIME type for Notation3.</dd>

<dt><code>text/tab-separated-values</code> (SELECT query responses only)</dt>
<dd>Tab-separated-value output, conforming to the (rather informal)
specification
<a href='http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/text/tab-separated-values'
>at IANA</a>.  The first line will include a row of 'column headings'
as above.</dd>
