<h1>Persistent storage of models</h1>

<p>The models in a Quaestor knowledgebase are by default transient –
if the Quaestor server is stopped, then the contents of the
knowledgebase disappear.  It is possible, however, to create a
persistent model (or, in Quaestor’s terms, a persistent submodel
within a ‘knowledgebase’), backed by a database, which will persist
between Quaestor invocations.</p>

<h2>Jena TDB</h2>

<p>The preferred persistence mechanism – certainly the simpler to set
up – uses the <a href='http://jena.sourceforge.net/TDB/' >Jena TDB library</a>.</p>

<p>To configure a persistent submodel, you must create the submodel by
PUTting appropriate metadata to a submodel's metadata URL.  You must
do this when creating the submodel – you cannot convert an existing
model to a persistent one by altering its metadata.  You declare that
the submodel, named by its URI, is of type
<code>quaestor:PersistentModel</code>, by PUTting RDF like the
following:</p>
<pre>
@prefix quaestor: &lt;http://ns.eurovotech.org/quaestor#&gt;.
&lt;&gt; a quaestor:PersistentModel.
</pre>
<p>Note that, since this RDF is parsed with the submodel's URI as its
base URI, you can most conveniently refer to the submodel as just
<code>&lt;&gt;</code> (or <code>rdf:about=""</code> when using
RDF/XML).</p>

<p>This will only work if the Quaestor server has been configured to
permit persistent models.</p>

<h2>Jena SDB</h2>

<p>The other persistence mechanism currently implemented in Quaestor is
one which uses the <a href='http://jena.sourceforge.net/SDB/'>Jena SDB
interface</a>.  This is more fully developed than TDB, and is probably
currently preferable for storing large volumes of data, although with
increasing maturity, TDB should take over this role, too.</p>

<p>To use this persistence mechanism, you must set up and initialise
your SDB database, as discussed at <a
href='http://jena.sourceforge.net/SDB/'>the Jena SDB support
pages</a>.  This is unfortunately a rather fiddly process.</p>

<p>Having done that, you create a new submodel for the knowledgebase,
by uploading RDF as described <a href='http.html'>elsewhere</a>.  In
this case, however, rather than the RDF being the content of the
submodel, it is a specification of the connection to the SDB database,
as described in <a
href='http://jena.hpl.hp.com/wiki/SDB/Store_Description' >the SDB
documentation</a>.  For example, if you had set up SDB
using a PostgreSQL database named <code>sdb1</code>, with a username
of <code>postgres</code>, then this configuration file might look as
follows:</p>
<pre>
@prefix rdf:      &lt;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#&gt; .
@prefix sdb:      &lt;http://jena.hpl.hp.com/2007/sdb#&gt; .

[] rdf:type sdb:Store;
        sdb:layout      "layout2/index";
        sdb:connection  _:c.

_:c rdf:type sdb:SDBConnection;
        sdb:sdbType     "postgresql";
        sdb:sdbHost     "localhost";
        sdb:sdbName     "sdb1";
        sdb:sdbUser     "postgres";
        sdb:driver      "org.postgresql.Driver".
</pre>

<p>After that, the contents of the SDB store will appear as part of
the knowledgebase containing this submodel.</p>
