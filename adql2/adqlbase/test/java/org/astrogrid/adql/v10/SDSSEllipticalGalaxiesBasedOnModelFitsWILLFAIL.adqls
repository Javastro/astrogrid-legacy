-- Find all galaxies with a deVaucouleours profile and the
-- photometric colors consistent with an elliptical galaxy. NOTE THAT THE
-- NAMES AND VALUES OF THE LIKELIHOODS HAVE CHANGED SINCE THE EDR; they are
-- now log likelihoods, and named accordingly (lDev is now lnlDev, etc.) to
-- indicate these are log likelihoods. This query has many conditions, and
-- also has the use of bitwise logic necessary for dealing with flags.

-- JL Note. Will fail until bitwise manipulation supported.
