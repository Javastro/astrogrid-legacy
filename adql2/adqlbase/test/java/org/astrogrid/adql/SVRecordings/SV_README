The SVRecordings directory contains a subdirectory for each RDBMS, eg: MYSQL.
Each subdirectory contains files with the extension .query
Each .query file has been produced by the AdqlCompilerSVTest program when
processing all of the ADQL/s files associated with the AdqlStoXTest unit tests.
A file will contain the input ADQL/s and the output SQL for comparison, produced
by the server side AdqlCompilerSV of the adql compiler.
