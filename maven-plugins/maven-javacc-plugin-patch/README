This project is a hack for the maven (version 1) javacc plugin. 
It corrects some inconsistencies in the jelly script and the documentation.
See the PATCH_README.txt file that is included in the jar.

To use this patched jar in a project, add a plugin dependency to your project.xml file.

NOTE. This is a simple patch of the jar file and its contents. 
      No java source has been downloaded to enable the project to be a true maven project on its own.
      There is a buildjar.sh file that will construct the jar file from its hacked contents.
