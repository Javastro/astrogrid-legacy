			<subsection name="Source files">
				<P> This project differs slightly from the layout in typical 
					Astrogrid projects. Usually, we place our source code in 
					/src/java and our JUnit code in test/java. However, the 
					layout for this project was generated automatically using 
					the Maven goal </P>
				<P> maven genapp </P>
				<P> which puts the source code under src/java and the test code 
					under src/test, with configuration files under /conf. 
					Although this seems to be the layout favoured by Maven 
					perhaps it would be better to stick to the uniform layout 
					we have already? Comments? </P>

		<section name="Documentation">
			<p> Any xml documents placed in the xdocs folder are automatically 
				processed into html when the site is built. Note the &lt;P&gt; 
				tags surrounding the text - it's easy to forget these and 
				wonder why your text hasn't rendered!</p>
		</section>
		<section name="Navigation">
			<p> A special file xdocs/navigation.xml can be added to place extra 
				links on the left hand side and header of the page. </p>
