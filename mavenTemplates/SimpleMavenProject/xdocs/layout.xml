			<subsection name="Source files">
				<P> This project places its source code in /src/java and its test code in /test/java, 
					in line with the standard adopted by other Astrogrid components.  However,
					it is worth noting that a skeleton project may be generated automatically
					by Maven using</P>
				<P> maven genapp </P>
				<P> which has a slightly different arrangement.  It is probably better to stick with
					the Astrogrid layout to avoid confusion.</P>

		<section name="Documentation">
			<p> Any xml documents placed in the xdocs folder are automatically 
				processed into html when the site is built. Note the &lt;P&gt; 
				tags surrounding the text - it's easy to forget these and 
				wonder why your text hasn't rendered!  If you want these generated documents
				to be deployed with the webapp in the war file, you will need to add an Ant copy task
				to Maven.xml.  Take a look at the maven.xml file for this project to see how it can be done.</p>
		</section>
		<subsection name="Navigation">
			<p> A special file xdocs/navigation.xml can be added to place extra 
				links on the left hand side and header of the page. </p>
