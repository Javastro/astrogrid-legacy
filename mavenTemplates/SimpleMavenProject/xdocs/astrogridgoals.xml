		<section name="Why have custom goals?">
			<P> Some of our components do not easily fit into the simple layout 
				of this project. Furthermore, some of Maven's built-in goals 
				are "works in progress" and do not do quite what they should. 
				In previous iterations we have got around this by adding extra 
				processing hanging on the front or end of existing built-in 
				goals. However, this had the side effect that often we would be 
				forced to run goals for a project which were not appropriate, 
				and we would then often get build failure errors which we had 
				to know it was OK to ignore. Furthermore, sometimes unintended jars and 
				wars were built as a by-product of the hacked build process 
				 and this caused confusion for users. 
				Hence, we have created custom goals that every component owner 
				should implement. In many cases (as for this simple project), 
				these goals will simply map directly onto existing Maven goals, 
				but they give us the power and flexibility to vary the build if 
				we need to. </P>
